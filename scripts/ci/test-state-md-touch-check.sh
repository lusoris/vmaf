# scripts/ci/test-state-md-touch-check.sh — fixtures for state-md-touch-check.sh.
#
# Stand-alone bash-only test driver. Builds a throw-away git repo
# under $(mktemp -d) so the diff input is real (not mocked), then
# exercises five canned cases covering the gate's predicate space:
#
#   1. fix: prefix in title, no state.md, no opt-out → FAIL
#   2. fix: prefix in title, with 'no state delta: REASON' → PASS
#   3. fix: prefix in title, diff touches state.md → PASS
#   4. neutral title, body has UNCHECKED Bug-status row → FAIL
#   5. neutral title, diff is docs-only, no trigger → PASS (gate inert)
#
# Plus a trio of regression cases that previously confused the
# trigger heuristic ("debug" should not fire, "Closes #" must fire,
# "BUG" upper-case must fire).
#
# Run from anywhere:
#   bash scripts/ci/test-state-md-touch-check.sh
#
# Prints a one-line summary per case and a final PASS / FAIL count.
