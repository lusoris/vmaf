# scripts/ci/ffmpeg-patches-surface-check.sh — local + CI gate for
# CLAUDE.md §12 r14 (ADR-0186 + ADR-0356): every PR that changes a
# libvmaf public-surface symbol consumed by ffmpeg-patches/*.patch
# must update at least one patch file in the same PR.
#
# Mirrors the deliverables-check.sh / ffmpeg-patches-check.sh
# convention so a contributor can run the same gate locally before
# `gh pr create`. Reads the PR body for an opt-out line, computes
# the diff between BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA (or merge-base origin/master),
# and intersects the diff against a "consumed set" extracted from
# the patches under ffmpeg-patches/.
#
# Detection algorithm (bash + grep, no AST):
#   1. Parse ffmpeg-patches/*.patch once, extract the union of:
#        - vmaf_<ident>          (libvmaf public C symbols)
#        - Vmaf<TitleCase>       (libvmaf public types: VmafModelConfig, VmafLogLevel, ...)
#        - --enable-libvmaf-*    (FFmpeg configure flags)
#        - libvmaf_<ident>       (pkg-config feature names: libvmaf_sycl, libvmaf_vulkan, ...)
#      Cache as a regex-friendly pipe-joined union in $tmp_consumed.
#
#   2. For the diff: collect every added/removed/renamed identifier
#      from non-comment lines under libvmaf/include/libvmaf/*.h, and
#      from lines under libvmaf/meson_options.txt that touch an
#      `option('<name>'` declaration.
#
#   3. If the consumed-set intersects the diff-set AND no
#      ffmpeg-patches/*.patch is in the diff → fail.
#
#   4. Opt-out: PR body line `no ffmpeg-patches update needed: <reason>`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci/ffmpeg-patches-surface-check.sh
#       Reads PR body from $PR_BODY env var or stdin.
#       Diff is computed from $BASE_SHA..$HEAD_SHA env vars,
#       or falls back to $(git merge-base origin/master HEAD)..HEAD.
#
#   PR_BODY="$(gh pr view 999 --json body -q .body)" \
#       scripts/ci/ffmpeg-patches-surface-check.sh
#
# Exits 0 on PASS or no-public-surface-touched, 1 on a missing
# patch update, 2 on an environment / setup error.
