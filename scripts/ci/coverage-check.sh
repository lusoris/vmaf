#
# Overall = unweighted average line coverage across every file in the gcovr
# summary (already filtered by gcovr to libvmaf/src/* and exclude test code,
# subprojects, /usr/*). Applies to upstream *and* fork-added code — we will
# be modifying upstream paths over time (SIMD fixes, refactors, bug fixes)
# and need a safety net.
#
# Security-critical = files under libvmaf/src/dnn/, plus opt.c and
# read_json_model.c (JSON + option parsing: user-supplied input paths).
# Files with zero gcovr data are skipped (no tests → nothing to assert).
#
# Why gcovr (not lcov): lcov sums hits/lines across every .gcno that names
# the same source — when foo.c is built into both libvmaf.so and N test
# binaries, lcov reports up to N+1× the real coverage and prints
# impossible >100% values (we observed dnn_api.c at 1176%). gcovr
# deduplicates by source path so the per-file numbers are honest.
# See ADR-0110.

  # macro/helper menu (the whole point of the refactor is per-extractor
  # 30-LOC skeletons), so the unit suite covers only the helpers the
  # current extractors call. The lower bar reflects the structural ceiling;
  # adding tests just to inflate this number would be code-shaped padding,
  # not real correctness coverage. Distinct from opt.c / read_json_model.c
  # which parse user-supplied input and are properly security-critical.
