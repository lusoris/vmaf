# scripts/git-hooks/pre-push-pr-body-lint.sh — standalone PR-body lint entry point.
#
# This script is the named, standalone sibling to scripts/git-hooks/pre-push.
# It contains only the PR-body deliverables validation logic so that it can
# be referenced directly from .pre-commit-config.yaml as a pre-push stage
# hook (pre-commit requires a single-purpose entry script per hook id).
#
# The omnibus scripts/git-hooks/pre-push delegates to this script when the
# hook is installed via `make hooks-install`. The two are kept in sync by
# sharing the same validator call: scripts/ci/validate-pr-body.sh.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - No-op if `gh` is not on PATH.
#   - No-op if HEAD has no open PR with this branch as head.
#   - No-op if the PR is a draft (CI's deep-dive-checklist skips drafts).
#   - Otherwise: fetches the PR body via `gh pr view`, computes the diff
#     via `git diff --name-only origin/master..HEAD`, and runs
#     scripts/ci/validate-pr-body.sh. Non-zero exit blocks the push.
#
# Bypass: `git push --no-verify` (standard escape hatch).
# See: docs/development/pr-body-sentinel-guide.md

pre-push-pr-body-lint: BLOCKED — PR body would fail the rule-enforcement.yml
deep-dive-checklist gate (ADR-0108).

Fix the body with:
  gh pr edit --body-file <path>

Then push again. See docs/development/pr-body-sentinel-guide.md for the
exact checkbox syntax and opt-out sentinel forms.

Bypass (skips ALL pre-push checks): git push --no-verify
