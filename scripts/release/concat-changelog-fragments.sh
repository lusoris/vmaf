# Concatenate per-PR changelog fragments under changelog.d/<section>/*.md
# into the rendered "Unreleased" body that lives in CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Sections are emitted in the Keep-a-Changelog order:
#   Added → Changed → Deprecated → Removed → Fixed → Security
# Each fragment is a stand-alone Markdown bullet (or block of bullets) and
# may end with an optional trailing newline; the script preserves layout.
#
# Inputs:
#   $REPO_ROOT/changelog.d/<section>/*.md   per-PR fragments
#   $REPO_ROOT/changelog.d/_pre_fragment_legacy.md  (optional) content
#       migrated from the pre-fragment Unreleased block; emitted verbatim
#       at the top of the Unreleased body so the existing entries are not
#       lost when the system flips on.
#
# Outputs (stdout): the rendered Unreleased body. Caller is responsible
# for splicing it into CHANGELOG.md (release-please does this at release
# time; CI runs --check to gate drift).
#
# Flags:
#   --check    Compare output against the in-tree CHANGELOG.md Unreleased
#              block; exit non-zero on drift. Used by the docs-fragments
#              CI lane.
#   --write    Rewrite CHANGELOG.md in place with the rendered body.
