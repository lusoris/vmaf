# AGENTS.md — scripts/

Orientation for agents working on the top-level scripts tree (excluding
`scripts/ci/`, which has its own AGENTS.md). Parent: [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Scope

```text
scripts/
  ci/               # CI utilities — separate AGENTS.md (see scripts/ci/AGENTS.md)
  dev/              # developer-time helpers (corpus generation, knob analysis)
  docs/             # ADR-0221 ADR-index fragment concatenation
  release/          # ADR-0221 CHANGELOG.md fragment concatenation
  setup/            # OS/distro setup dispatcher + per-distro scripts
  gen_smoke_onnx.py                  # tiny-AI smoke fixture generator (deterministic)
  gen_mobilesal_placeholder_onnx.py  # MobileSal placeholder fixture (T6-2a, ADR-0218)
  gen_ssimulacra2_eotf_lut.py        # sRGB EOTF LUT generator
  run_unittests.sh                   # legacy Python test runner (upstream-mirror)
  test-matrix.sh                     # local docker-matrix harness
```

This is the catch-all for tooling that doesn't belong in
`libvmaf/tools/` (the C CLI lives there) or `tools/` (fork-original
Python/shell user tooling). Most files here are fork-original and
have no upstream-Netflix equivalent.

## Ground rules

- **Parent rules** apply (see [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)).
- **`set -euo pipefail` at the top of every shell script.** Pipes
  carry errors; unset variables are fatal.
- **All wholly-new fork shell scripts ship the dual Lusoris/Claude
  (Anthropic) copyright header**. Two upstream-mirror scripts
  (`run_unittests.sh`, parts of `setup/`) preserve their original
  headers — do not retro-fit the dual notice on those.
- **Python helpers under `dev/` import from `ai/`** for shared
  schema helpers (`SweepRow`, knob analysis); keep the import side
  free of side-effects (no eager model loads at module import).

## Rebase-sensitive invariants

### `release/concat-changelog-fragments.sh` is the source of truth for `CHANGELOG.md`

Per [ADR-0221](../docs/adr/0221-changelog-adr-fragment-pattern.md),
`CHANGELOG.md` is **rendered** from per-PR fragments under
`changelog.d/<section>/*.md`. The script:

- Renders Keep-a-Changelog section ordering (Added → Changed →
  Deprecated → Removed → Fixed → Security).
- Preserves `changelog.d/_pre_fragment_legacy.md` verbatim at the
  top (migrated content from the pre-fragment Unreleased block).
- Supports `--check` (CI gate) and `--write` (release-please
  rewrite) flags.

**On rebase**: do **not** edit `CHANGELOG.md` by hand. Edit a
fragment, then run the script with `--write`. The CI lane
`docs-fragments` runs `--check` on every PR and fails on drift.
Renaming the script breaks `release-please` config + the CI gate
in the same instant.

### `docs/concat-adr-index.sh` is the source of truth for `docs/adr/README.md`

Per [ADR-0221](../docs/adr/0221-changelog-adr-fragment-pattern.md),
`docs/adr/README.md` is **rendered** from per-ADR fragments under
`docs/adr/_index_fragments/*.md`:

- `_header.md` is the verbatim README prelude (everything before
  `## Index`).
- One Markdown row per ADR, named by the ADR's full slug
  (`NNNN-kebab-case.md`). Slug-keyed for historical reasons: the
  2026-05-02 dedup sweep renumbered duplicate-NNNN ADRs; slug
  filenames remain stable across that remap.
- Rows render oldest-first by ADR ID.

**On rebase**: do **not** edit `docs/adr/README.md` by hand. Add
or edit a fragment file, then run with `--write`. Renaming the
script or changing the slug-keyed naming breaks every ADR-ID
remap downstream.

### `gen_smoke_onnx.py` and `gen_*_onnx.py` are deterministic

The fixture-generation scripts must produce byte-identical output
on re-run. The shipped `model/tiny/smoke_v0.onnx` and
`model/tiny/mobilesal.onnx` are checked-in, sha256-pinned in
`model/tiny/registry.json`, and verified by the C-side loader
(`libvmaf/src/dnn/model_loader.c`). A non-deterministic regen breaks
the registry sha256 + the smoke gate. **On rebase**: keep
`onnx.helper.make_model(..., producer_name=..., producer_version=...,
ir_version=...)` pinned at fixed values; do not let `onnx` minor
version drift change the output bytes. The same lesson is encoded
in `ai/AGENTS.md` for the bisect-cache fixtures.

### `gen_ssimulacra2_eotf_lut.py` regen is a Netflix-golden-adjacent event

The generated LUT at `libvmaf/src/feature/ssimulacra2_eotf_lut.h`
removes the runtime `libm powf` dependency from the SSIMULACRA 2
hot path. `powf` varies by ~1 ULP between glibc / musl / macOS
libSystem, which compounds to ~2e-4 per-frame drift in the pooled
score. **On rebase**: do not regenerate the LUT casually — a
regen changes the SSIMULACRA 2 fork-added regression-gate values
in `python/test/ssimulacra2_test.py` (per ADR-0164). If the LUT
needs to change, justify it in the commit message and walk the
regression test.

### `setup/detect.sh` is the per-OS dispatcher

The dispatcher reads `/etc/os-release` on Linux and `$OSTYPE` on
macOS to pick `setup/<distro>.sh` or `setup/macos.sh`. Adding a
new distro is one new file (`setup/foo.sh`) plus one branch in
`detect.sh`. The dispatcher is idempotent and never sudo-escalates
without user input — keep both invariants on rebase.

### `dev/hw_encoder_corpus.py` is the canonical corpus producer

Consumed by `tools/ensemble-training-kit/02-generate-corpus.sh`
and by the LOSO retrain runbook
([ADR-0309](../docs/adr/0309-fr-regressor-v2-ensemble-real-corpus-retrain.md)).
The producer's output schema (`(src, actual_kbps, vmaf, enc_ms,
recipe)`) is currently *not* aligned with the
`analyze_knob_sweep.SweepRow` consumer — see
[`ai/AGENTS.md`](../ai/AGENTS.md) "knob-sweep corpus invariant"
for the throw-away wrapper that performs the rename until
SCHEMA_VERSION=3 lands. **Do not** modify `analyze_knob_sweep.py`
to accept both spellings; producer-side rename is the path forward.

### `run_unittests.sh` is upstream-mirror

This script is part of the original Netflix Python test harness
(invokes `python3 -m unittest discover` against `python/test/`).
Keep it byte-identical on rebase. The fork's CI uses meson +
pytest paths; this file ships unchanged for upstream-sync hygiene.

## Twin-update awareness

- **Renaming any script** here that is referenced from
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` requires the workflow update in the
  **same PR**. Phantom-required gates compound across the merge
  train.
- **`scripts/ci/AGENTS.md`** is the sister doc for the CI tree;
  changes that cross the boundary (e.g. moving a CI helper out of
  `ci/` into `dev/`) update both AGENTS.md files.
