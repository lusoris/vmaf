"""Smoke tests for Research-0026 feature-set additions.

The Phase-1 deliverable in Research-0026 extends
``ai/data/feature_extractor.py`` with a ``FULL_FEATURES`` tuple +
``FEATURE_SETS`` registry + ``resolve_feature_set`` helper. These
tests cover the registry / resolver only — calling ``extract_features``
itself requires a built libvmaf CLI and is exercised in
``test_netflix_loader.py`` against the canonical 6-feature path.
