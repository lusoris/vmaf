"""Heteroscedastic-regression utilities for tiny-AI MOS predictors.

When a model emits (score, logvar) instead of a single scalar it can
tell callers *how uncertain* the prediction is — a C1 model whose MOS
is 65 ± 3 is very different from 65 ± 15, even though the point
estimate is identical. This module holds the small, dependency-free
math that converts between logvar, σ, and confidence intervals so
inference-time consumers don't re-derive it.

The loss used in training is Gaussian NLL with a floor on σ to prevent
the model from gaming the objective by predicting huge variances on
hard samples:

    NLL = 0.5 * (logvar + (y - μ)² / exp(logvar))
