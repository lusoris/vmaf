# MCP Server Release Channel

The fork ships **two** MCP server flavours:

1. The standalone Python server under `mcp-server/vmaf-mcp/`
   ([`docs/mcp/tools.md`](tools.md)).
2. The embedded server inside `libvmaf` itself, exposed via the
   `libvmaf_mcp.h` C surface
   ([`docs/mcp/embedded.md`](embedded.md)).

[ADR-0166](../adr/0166-mcp-server-release-channel.md) governs the
standalone Python server release channel. The `vmaf-mcp`
distribution is published to PyPI from the same release flow as the
libvmaf fork, uses the fork's `v3.x.y-lusoris.N` version line, and
is signed through the same keyless Sigstore/OIDC pipeline.

Operators should install the standalone server from PyPI when an
agent needs a child-process tool surface:

```bash
pip install vmaf-mcp
```

For local development from a checkout:

```bash
cd mcp-server/vmaf-mcp
pip install -e .
```

Set `VMAF_BIN=/abs/path/to/vmaf` when the built CLI is not at the
repo-default `build/tools/vmaf`, and set `VMAF_MCP_ALLOW` to any
additional corpus roots the server is allowed to read.

Embedded-MCP users do not install `vmaf-mcp`; they build libvmaf
with `-Denable_mcp=true` and the needed transport flags, then call
the `libvmaf_mcp.h` C API from the host process. The embedded server
is not a separate package. Its ABI and version ride with libvmaf
itself: the public symbols live in `libvmaf_mcp.h`, the
implementation is compiled by `-Denable_mcp=true`, and compatibility
follows the libvmaf SOVERSION. That keeps client expectations simple:
a libvmaf build advertises the embedded transports it actually
compiled via `vmaf_mcp_transport_available()`, while the Python
package advertises the standalone CLI-wrapping tool surface.

## Release Checklist

For a libvmaf release:

- Build with the intended MCP flags and run `test_mcp_smoke`.
- Confirm `vmaf_mcp_available()` and
  `vmaf_mcp_transport_available()` match the release configuration.
- Keep embedded MCP behavior documented in
  [`embedded.md`](embedded.md), not in the Python package README.

For a `vmaf-mcp` Python package release:

- Build from `mcp-server/vmaf-mcp/`.
- Keep the tool schemas in [`tools.md`](tools.md) aligned with
  `mcp-server/vmaf-mcp/src/vmaf_mcp/server.py`.
- Publish and sign through the same release workflow used for the
  rest of the fork.
