# Research-0090: AGENTS.md per-package coverage audit (2026-05-09)

Scope: every code-bearing directory under `libvmaf/src/`, `tools/`, `ai/`,
`python/vmaf/`, `mcp-server/`, `scripts/`. Goal: confirm that every
package with rebase-sensitive invariants ships an `AGENTS.md` per
CLAUDE.md §12 r11 / [ADR-0108](../adr/0108-deep-dive-deliverables-rule.md).

## Methodology

1. Enumerate all code-bearing directories (1+ `.c` / `.h` / `.cpp` /
   `.cu` / `.py` / `.sh` / `.comp` file at depth 1).
2. For each, classify as one of:
   - **EXISTS — current**: AGENTS.md present and meaningfully covers
     the package's invariants.
   - **EXISTS — stale**: AGENTS.md present but cites removed code or
     wrong invariants (none found in this audit).
   - **MISSING — needs backfill**: directory has rebase-sensitive code
     patterns (twin-update rules, upstream-mirror discipline,
     ADR-pinned algorithms, bit-exactness gates) but no AGENTS.md.
   - **N/A — no invariants**: pure fork-original docs / configs /
     generated artefacts, or fully covered by a parent AGENTS.md.
3. For MISSING entries, read 5–10 representative files in the package
   to extract the actual rebase-sensitive patterns before writing.
4. Quality > quantity: an AGENTS.md that just restates the parent
   document is worse than no file.

## Counts

- EXISTS — current: 18
- EXISTS — stale: 0
- MISSING — backfilled: 13
- N/A — no invariants / parent-covered: 13

## Findings

1. **No genuinely stale AGENTS.md found.** Every existing file cites
   real code and real ADRs. The fork's discipline of updating AGENTS.md
   in the same PR as the code change has held up across the last ~50
   PRs.
2. **The biggest gap was under `libvmaf/src/feature/`.** The parent
   `feature/AGENTS.md` is comprehensive (655 lines) and captures the
   per-extractor invariants, but the SIMD-twin / GPU-twin / scalar-
   reference tree split underneath it had no per-package orientation.
   A new contributor opening `feature/x86/ssim_avx2.c` cold had to
   read the parent file end-to-end to find the ADR-0138 / 0139
   bit-exactness contract that governs the file.
3. **The third-party trees inherit the most rebase risk.** Both
   `feature/iqa/` (tdistler 2011) and `feature/third_party/xiph/`
   (Xiph psnr_hvs) are scalar references that a half-dozen SIMD
   ports depend on byte-for-byte. The fork has accumulated several
   load-bearing modifications (ADR-0146 / 0148 helper splits and
   reserved-id renames in `iqa/`; ADR-0159 / 0160 lockstep contract
   for Xiph). Without an AGENTS.md these were only documented in
   the parent file and the ADRs themselves — easy to miss on a
   surface-level rebase.
4. **Vulkan has a 2-tier package**: `feature/vulkan/*.c` (host glue)
   vs `feature/vulkan/shaders/*.comp` (GLSL). They have *different*
   rebase-sensitive surfaces (host: descriptor pool sizing,
   plane-loop semantics; shaders: `precise` / `NoContraction`
   placement, ADR-0264 driver-bug carve-out). Two AGENTS.md files
   make sense here.
5. **`scripts/{setup,dev,docs,release}/` were a coverage gap.** The
   ADR-0221 fragment-concat scripts (`concat-changelog-fragments.sh`,
   `concat-adr-index.sh`) are the source of truth for two
   high-traffic CI-gated files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/adr/README.md`).
   A rename or signature change in either silently breaks every
   subsequent PR. This deserved a written invariant note.

## Follow-ups

- None opened. The 13 MISSING entries are all addressed by this PR.
  No state.md row is opened — the audit confirms the discipline is
  holding, the gaps are filled, and there is no follow-up
  meta-coverage work outstanding.
