## What the preprint is

*Advances in Neural Video Compression: A Review and Benchmarking* (Gao
et al. 2026). Taxonomy of scene-agnostic vs scene-adaptive Neural Video
Compression (NVC) across paradigms / backbones / test protocols
(258 references), followed by an empirical BD-rate + complexity
benchmark of DCVC-DC/FM/RT, MaskCRT, PNVC, GIViC, NVRC, HiNeRV, C3
against VTM-20, AV1-3.8.1, ECM-12, AVM-2 on UVG / MCL-JCV / HEVC B-E /
AOM A2-A5 with PSNR, MS-SSIM, **VMAF** as quality metrics.

The paper is *not* about VMAF directly, but uses VMAF as one of three
reporting metrics throughout §6 and lifts several pieces of prior art
that map directly to fork-local surfaces.

## Direct relevance to this fork (ranked by actionability)

### 1. Tiny-AI training corpus expansion — BVI-AOM ingest (1 week + ADR)

**Surface**: `ai/src/vmaf_train/data/datasets.py`,
`docs/ai/training-data.md`. Mirror the existing BVI-DVC manifest.

The paper's Table 2 catalogues canonical NVC training/test sets:
**BVI-DVC** (Ma, Zhang, Bull 2021 — already ingested) and **BVI-AOM**
(Nawała et al. 2024 — *new actionable data we don't ingest*). 956
sequences, AOM-CTC-aligned. Concrete change: add BVI-AOM ingest path
next to the existing BVI-DVC one.

Source: §5.1.1, Table 2, refs [216,217,224].

### 2. NEG-VMAF caveat in `fr_regressor_v1` model card (1 day, no ADR)

**Surface**: `ai/src/vmaf_train/models/fr_regressor.py`,
`docs/ai/models/fr_regressor_v1.md`.

§5.3 cites Siniukov et al. 2021 [238] on "VMAF hacking by pre/post
processing" and Netflix's NEG-VMAF response [235]. Our
`fr_regressor_v1` is trained as a VMAF regressor and inherits this
vulnerability. Concrete change: add a NEG-style adversarial holdout
(sharpened/contrast-boosted distortions) to the eval suite, document
the NEG caveat in the model card.

Source: §5.3, refs [235], [238].

### 3. ST-VMAF / Zhang-2021 prior art for `fr_regressor_v2` design space (1 day digest)

**Surface**: future `fr_regressor_v2`, model registry.

§5.3 cites Bampis et al. 2018 [236] (ST-VMAF, spatiotemporal feature
integration) and Zhang et al. 2021 [237] ("Enhancing VMAF through new
feature integration and model combination", PCS 2021, Bull lab) as
published improvements over stock VMAF. These are direct prior work
on the architectural axis our `fr_regressor` already explores
(motion-aware FR fusion). Read [237], compare its feature set to our
Phase-3 sweep, file a research digest. Multi-week if we re-implement.

Source: §5.3, refs [236,237].

### 4. NVC-style BD-rate report recipe (1 day, doc-only)

**Surface**: `python/vmaf/tools/bd_rate_calculator.py`,
`docs/usage/`.

Tables 3 & 4 use VMAF as a co-equal axis with PSNR and MS-SSIM for
BD-rate against VTM-20 LD/RA. Our `bd_rate_calculator.py` exists; we
lack a documented "NVC-style BD-rate report" recipe that mirrors the
paper's protocol on UVG / MCL-JCV / HEVC B-E so users can reproduce
the standard table.

Source: §5.4, §6.1, Tables 3-4, ref [255] (Bjøntegaard).

### 5. DISTS extractor as LPIPS companion (1 week, ADR)

**Surface**: `libvmaf/src/dnn/`, `model/tiny/`.

§5.3 discusses LPIPS [239] *and* DISTS [240, Ding et al. PAMI 2020]
as the deep-feature FR pair widely used for video quality. We ship
`lpips_sq.onnx` but no DISTS extractor. Concrete change: scaffold a
`dists_sq` extractor analogous to `feature_lpips.c`. ONNX export +
op-allowlist check + ADR per ADR-0041 pattern.

Source: §5.3, ref [240].

**Not-relevant count**: ~225 of 258 — entropy-coding theory, NeRF /
Gaussian-splatting variants, end-to-end NVC architectures (DCVC-*,
MaskCRT, GIViC, HiNeRV, NVRC, PNVC), normalizing-flow priors,
vector-quantization variants, LMM-based VQA. These describe full
neural codecs and codec internals — interesting context but no
actionable mapping to a fork-local file. The fork is a quality-metric
library, not a codec.

## Backlog candidates

### Short — `T7-NEG-VMAF` (1 day, no ADR)

**Title**: document NEG / hacking caveat in `fr_regressor_v1` model
card.

**Scope**: add one section to `docs/ai/models/fr_regressor_v1.md`
citing Siniukov [238] and NEG-VMAF [235], plus a smoke eval on a
sharpened-distortion holdout under `ai/scripts/` to confirm whether
the regressor inherits the same vulnerability profile as upstream
VMAF.

**Success criterion**: model card updated, smoke eval committed,
PLCC/SROCC delta on the sharpened-set documented.

### Long — `T7-BVI-AOM-INGEST` (1 week, ADR needed)

**Title**: add BVI-AOM as a second training corpus for
`fr_regressor_v2`.

**Scope**: mirror `BVI-DVC` ingest in
`ai/src/vmaf_train/data/datasets.py`, add a manifest under
`ai/src/vmaf_train/data/manifests/`, set up LOSO splits, retrain
`fr_regressor_v2` on combined BVI-DVC + BVI-AOM + KoNViD-1k corpus,
compare PLCC/SROCC against v1 baseline.

**Success criterion**: v2 ONNX checkpoint registered with PLCC ≥ v1 +
0.01 on held-out test set; LOSO results table in research digest.

## Bottom line

The paper is a codec-side review, so most of its 258 refs are out of
scope for a quality-metric fork. The actionable signal lives in §5
(Test Protocols) and §5.3 (Quality Measures): BVI-AOM as new training
data, NEG-VMAF / Siniukov as a hardening axis for the FR regressor,
ST-VMAF / Zhang-2021 as direct prior art for the FR regressor's
design space, and DISTS as a clean LPIPS-companion extractor
candidate.
