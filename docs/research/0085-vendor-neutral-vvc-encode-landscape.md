# Research-0085: Vendor-neutral VVC GPU encode landscape

- **Status**: Active — most factual claims now verified against primary
  sources. A small number of items remain `[UNVERIFIED]` because they

## Verification status — read before citing

This digest was originally drafted (subagent-authored, 2026-05-05) with
several `[verified]` tags that were **not actually verified against the
linked documentation**. It was downgraded to `Status: SKELETON` and every
unverified claim was tagged `[UNVERIFIED]`. The 2026-05-06 revision
(this version) re-runs every open question against primary sources and
flips claims to `[verified]` where a primary source confirms them.

What is verified at write time, with linked source:

What remains `[UNVERIFIED]` and why:

| Eng-month estimate for HIP-port of vvenc hot kernels | Depends on the profile result above plus an upstream-port-roadmap signal. Both sit in the future-work queue. |

## Question

User (lawrence, 2026-05-05): *"Gotta wonder if you could make CUDA VVC
without nvidia."*

Translated and de-colloquialised: can the fork ship a GPU-accelerated
VVC (H.266) encode path that does **not** require NVIDIA hardware?
Today the fork's only VVC adapter shells out to Fraunhofer HHI's
**CPU** `vvenc` reference encoder. The question is whether a
vendor-neutral GPU encode story exists today, near-term, or only on a
multi-year horizon — and what the cost/value ladder looks like.

## Findings

### F0. NO vendor ships hardware VVC encode silicon as of 2026-05-06

NVIDIA NVENC SDK 13.0, AMD AMF SDK v1.5.0, and Intel oneVPL 2.16.0
**all** lack VVC encode in their public encoder component lists.
oneVPL ships VVC profile/level enums and `MFX_CODEC_VVC`, but the
runtime (`intel/vpl-gpu-rt`) wires those through to **decode** on
Lunar Lake, not encode. The "vendor-neutral GPU VVC encode" question
therefore has an unusually direct answer today: there is no GPU VVC
encode path on **any** vendor.

### F1. Vulkan-side scoring is shipped today; Vulkan-side encoding is not

The fork has a Vulkan compute backend ([ADR-0127](../adr/0127-vulkan-compute-backend.md))
for VMAF scoring. This is the basis for the sibling
[ADR-0314](../adr/0314-vmaf-tune-vulkan-score-quick-win.md) (separate
PR) which wires `vmaf-tune --score-backend=vulkan`. That gives
non-NVIDIA users vendor-neutral GPU **scoring** of CPU-encoded VVC
bitstreams.

There is no Vulkan-side **encode** path today: `VK_KHR_video_encode_h266`
does not exist in the Khronos registry (verified 404). Even if Khronos
ratified it tomorrow, the AV1 precedent (Nov-2024 ratification → Aug-2025
RADV implementation, ~9-month spec-to-driver lag) suggests realistic
delivery is multi-quarter at minimum after ratification.

### F2. NN-VC is the de-facto vendor-neutral GPU contribution today

VVC's neural-video-coding tools (NN-intra prediction, NN-loop-filter,
NN-super-resolution) run as ONNX models inside the encoder. The
fork's `vvenc.py` adapter exposes them via `--nnvc-intra`,
`--nnvc-loop-filter`, `--nnvc-sr` (verified by reading the file).
ONNX Runtime EP matrix (verified) covers CUDA, ROCm, DirectML,
OpenVINO, CoreML, WebGPU, QNN, TensorRT, CANN — vendor-neutrality of
the *neural portion* is well-supported.

The catch: NN-VC accelerates the **quality** of the encode, not the
**throughput**. The CPU encoder loops still run on CPU; the GPU is
only burning the NN-intra inference. Quality-lift magnitude
remains `[UNVERIFIED]` (no primary-source benchmark on the fork's
representative corpus); the bitrate-at-iso-VMAF claim from the original
draft is parked for a future fork-side benchmark.

### F3. HIP / SYCL port of vvenc hot kernels — feasibility skeleton

The original draft proposed a HIP port of vvenc's motion-estimation,
transform, and loop-filter kernels as Tier 2. The skeleton remains
plausible but per-kernel CPU-time distribution and engineering-month
estimates remain `[UNVERIFIED]`. Confirmed for Tier-2 promotion:

1. A profile run of CPU vvenc on a representative corpus to confirm
   the per-kernel CPU-time distribution. **Not yet done** — Tier-2
   ADR demands this as the prerequisite.
2. Upstream vvenc's GPU-port roadmap: **no public CUDA / HIP / SYCL /
   OpenCL / Vulkan port** in the issue tracker (verified
   `[verified]`). HHI's private roadmap is `[UNVERIFIED]`.
3. Hardware availability for ongoing CI per ADR-0214's GPU-parity
   rule remains an open organisational question.

### F4. ZLUDA is technically interesting but not actionable

ZLUDA could in principle run a (hypothetical) closed-source CUDA
VVC encoder on AMD / Intel hardware. In practice (a) no
open-source CUDA VVC encoder exists, and (b) ZLUDA's verified module
list (`zluda_blas`, `zluda_blaslt`, `zluda_fft`, `zluda_dnn{,8,9}`,
`zluda_sparse`, Driver+Runtime APIs) does **not** include
NVENC/NVDEC. Even an immediate hypothetical CUDA-VVC binary would not
run unless ZLUDA also implemented the NVENC/NVDEC API surface. Not a
near-term path.

## Cost / risk / value matrix

The original draft's matrix included a row "A. NVENC h266 adapter"
that depended on the fabricated NVENC-encode premise; that row is
**removed**. Remaining rows now carry verified vendor-status data:

| Path | Effort | License risk | User value | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vulkan-scoring quick-win** ([ADR-0314](../adr/0314-vmaf-tune-vulkan-score-quick-win.md), sibling) | Small | None | Non-NVIDIA users get GPU scoring for VVC encodes (encode stays on CPU) | **Tier 1**: ship now via the sibling PR. |
| **NN-VC documentation + corpus integration** | Small | Mixed (NN-VC weights are LGPL-derived; tooling is Apache-2.0) — `[UNVERIFIED]` exact split | Any-GPU users; quality lift magnitude `[UNVERIFIED]` until benchmarked | **Tier 1**: bundle with Vulkan-scoring rollout. |
| **HIP port of vvenc hot kernels** | Medium-large; per-kernel CPU-time distribution `[UNVERIFIED]` until profiled | Apache-2.0 OK; Fraunhofer patent licence still applies | RDNA 3 / 4 / CDNA users; speedup `[UNVERIFIED]` until profile + prototype | **Tier 2**: gated on Tier 1 success and corpus profile. |
| **SYCL port of same kernels** | Incremental over HIP | Apache-2.0 OK | Adds Intel PVC / Xe2 + cross-vendor via Codeplay plugins | **Tier 2.5**: deferred. |
| **Vulkan Video VVC encode adapter** | Driver-side does the work; libvmaf-side small | None | All vendors once silicon + drivers ship | **Tier 3**: revisit quarterly; gated on `VK_KHR_video_encode_h266` ratification (does **not exist** today, verified 404) + at least one driver shipping. |
| **ZLUDA-hosted CUDA-VVC** | n/a | Risky | Zero today (no open-source CUDA VVC encoder; ZLUDA also does not cover NVENC) | **Rejected**. |
| **Wait for AMD/Intel hardware VVC encode** | 0 (passive) | None | None until silicon ships (Lunar Lake = decode-only; Battlemage = no VVC) | Reflected in Tier 3's "revisit". |

## Recommendations (priority order)

### Tier 1 — ship today (small total effort)

1. **Wire vmaf-tune's existing Vulkan scoring** so non-NVIDIA users
   benefit from GPU-accelerated *scoring* of CPU-encoded VVC bitstreams.
   Scoped separately as **ADR-0314** (sibling PR — this digest does
   not implement it).
2. **Document NN-VC as the vendor-neutral GPU contribution today**
   in the user-facing docs. Be explicit that:
   - Hardware VVC encode does **not** exist on any GPU vendor (verified
     for NVIDIA SDK 13.0, AMD AMF v1.5.0, Intel oneVPL 2.16.0).
   - VVenC is the open-source CPU encoder; encoder loops stay on
     CPU but neural tools accelerate on GPU via ONNX Runtime EPs.
   - Vulkan-side scoring closes the GPU loop on the consumption side.

### Tier 2 — backlog, demand-pulled

**HIP port of vvenc's motion-estimation + transform + loop-filter
kernels.** Triggered only when **all three** are true:

- A user has reported CPU-vvenc throughput as a binding constraint
  on a real corpus (not a synthetic benchmark).
- Tier-1 Vulkan-scoring + NN-VC docs have landed and at least one
  downstream consumer is using NN-VC tools through `vmaf-tune` in
  production.
- An RDNA 3 / RDNA 4 or Intel PVC machine is available to the fork
  for ongoing CI (without it the HIP port has no automated
  regression gate and ADR-0214's GPU-parity rule is unenforceable).

If any of the three is false, Tier 2 stays in the backlog. This
matches the fork's "demand-pulled fork-local effort" pattern from
ADR-0009.

### Tier 3 — speculative, revisit quarterly

**Vulkan Video VVC encode adapter.** Triggered by:

- `VK_KHR_video_encode_h266` ratification — verified **does not exist
  today** (Khronos registry 404; zero Vulkan-Docs issues mention it).
- At least one driver shipping the extension once ratified (Mesa RADV,
  NVIDIA proprietary, or ANV — any one suffices to start).
- A libvmaf-side encode adapter design proposal (currently the
  fork's Vulkan code is score-only).

## Reproducer / verification commands

```bash
# 1. Confirm what NVENC actually supports (verified 2026-05-06):
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,driver_version --format=csv
ffmpeg -hide_banner -encoders 2>&1 | grep -iE 'nvenc|h266|vvc'
# expected: h264_nvenc / hevc_nvenc / av1_nvenc; no h266_nvenc.

# 2. Confirm AMF / QSV do NOT expose VVC encode (verified 2026-05-06):
ffmpeg -hide_banner -encoders 2>&1 | grep -iE 'h266|vvc'
# expected: only libvvenc enumerates;
# no h266_amf / h266_qsv / h266_nvenc.

# 3. Vulkan-Video extension presence (verified 2026-05-06):
vulkaninfo | grep -iE 'video_(encode|decode)_(h264|h265|av1|h266)'
# expected: h264 / h265 / av1 encode/decode may be present
# on RDNA 3+ (RADV 25.2+) / Battlemage (ANV); h266 absent on all.

# 4. Confirm Khronos registry has no VK_KHR_video_encode_h266:
curl -sIL https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_video_encode_h266.html | head -3
# expected: HTTP 404 (verified 2026-05-06).

# 5. Fork's CPU adapter still works for vendor-neutral encode:
python -m vmaftune encode --codec libvvenc --preset slow \
    --input testdata/yuv/akiyo_qcif.yuv --qp 32 --output /tmp/akiyo.266

# 6. NN-VC tools on whatever GPU is present (ONNX Runtime auto-EP):
python -m vmaftune encode --codec libvvenc --preset medium \
    --nnvc-intra --input testdata/yuv/akiyo_qcif.yuv --qp 32 \
    --output /tmp/akiyo_nnvc.266

# 7. UNVERIFIED-tag count should drop after this revision:
grep -c '\[UNVERIFIED\]' docs/research/0085-vendor-neutral-vvc-encode-landscape.md
# expected: small number (legitimate gaps: NN-VC quality lift,
# vvenc kernel CPU-time distribution, eng-month estimates).
```

## Open questions (substantive — block promotion of dependent work)

The original 10 open questions are now mostly closed. Remaining gaps:

1. **NN-VC quality-lift magnitude** — actual bitrate-at-iso-VMAF lift
   on representative corpora. Requires running VVenC NN-VC vs. baseline
   on a representative corpus. No primary-source publishes a number for
   the fork's specific use case. **Stays open**, scoped to a future
   Tier-1 follow-up benchmark.
2. **HIP-portability of vvenc kernels** — actual CPU-time distribution
   per kernel on a real corpus. Requires `perf` profiling. **Stays
   open**, scoped to the Tier-2 prerequisite.
3. **Fraunhofer HHI VVenC private GPU-port roadmap** — public issue
   tracker is empty (verified `[verified]`); HHI may have non-public
   plans. Cannot be answered from public sources alone. **Stays open**;
   re-check on every quarterly Tier-3 revisit.

Closed (as of 2026-05-06) by primary-source verification:

1. AMD AMF VVC encode → **no**, verified.
2. Intel oneVPL VVC encode → API enums present (oneVPL 2.15+), but
   runtime ships **decode** on Lunar Lake only; encode not in any
   release notes through 2.16.0. Verified.
3. Intel Lunar Lake / Battlemage VVC decode → Lunar Lake **yes**,
   Battlemage **no**. Verified.
4. Khronos `VK_KHR_video_encode_h266` → **does not exist**, verified
   by registry 404 and zero Vulkan-Docs issues.
5. Mesa AV1 encode → Mesa 25.2 (RADV, August 2025). Verified.
6. Mesa VVC decode → not in Mesa Vulkan; Lunar Lake VVC decode reaches
   users via Intel iHD VA-API media driver + FFmpeg. Verified.
7. ZLUDA codec-workload coverage → zero (no NVENC/NVDEC module in
   tree). Verified.
