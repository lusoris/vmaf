# CUDA Backend

The CUDA backend runs VMAF's core feature extractors (VIF, ADM, Motion)
directly on an NVIDIA GPU, keeping frames on the device across the full
pipeline to avoid PCIe round-trips.

## Build

```bash
meson setup build -Denable_cuda=true
ninja -C build
```

Requires the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc`, driver API headers). The build uses the
driver API only — through `ffnvcodec` dynlink wrappers — so applications
that already load CUDA through FFmpeg share the same primary context.

Meson options:

- `-Denable_cuda=true` — compile the CUDA backend + kernels.
- `-Denable_nvtx=true` — instrument kernels with NVTX ranges (see [nvtx/profiling.md](../nvtx/profiling.md)).
- `-Denable_nvcc=true` — build NVCC-compiled kernel objects (default when `enable_cuda` is on).

## Runtime

When the binary is built with CUDA, the backend is auto-selected on GPU-capable
hosts. CLI controls:

```bash
./build/tools/vmaf ...            # CUDA used automatically
./build/tools/vmaf --no_cuda ...  # force CPU path
```

The FFmpeg filter name is `libvmaf_cuda` — see [usage/ffmpeg.md](../../usage/ffmpeg.md)
for a hwaccel pipeline that keeps decoded frames on the GPU.

## Source layout

```text
libvmaf/src/cuda/                # queue, picture, ring-buffer runtime
libvmaf/src/feature/cuda/        # per-feature kernels
  integer_vif_cuda.{c,h}         # VIF extractor dispatch
  integer_vif/                   # VIF .cu kernels
  integer_adm_cuda.{c,h}         # ADM extractor dispatch
  integer_adm/                   # ADM .cu kernels
  integer_motion_cuda.{c,h}      # Motion extractor dispatch
  integer_motion/                # Motion .cu kernels
```

Adding a new CUDA extractor: see [`/add-feature-extractor`](../../../.claude/skills/add-feature-extractor/SKILL.md).

## Design notes

- **Driver API only.** We link against `cuda.h` via `ffnvcodec` and do not
  depend on the CUDA Runtime API. This keeps libvmaf linkable against FFmpeg
  builds that already load CUDA dynamically.
- **Pinned host staging.** Input pictures are uploaded from
  `cuMemHostAlloc`-pinned buffers. See [picture_cuda.c](../../../libvmaf/src/cuda/picture_cuda.c).
- **Non-default streams per extractor.** Each feature extractor owns its own
  stream so submit/collect for different features can overlap.
- **Ring-buffered double-buffer submit.** Frame N+1 starts uploading while
  frame N is still on the device — see [ring_buffer.c](../../../libvmaf/src/cuda/ring_buffer.c).
- **Shared primary context.** We retain the device's primary context with
  `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain` so FFmpeg and VMAF share one GPU context rather
  than fighting over time-sliced contexts.

## Profiling

See [nvtx/profiling.md](../nvtx/profiling.md) for Nsight Systems recipes that
rely on the backend's NVTX annotations.
