# ADR-0295: `vmaf-tune` HDR-aware encoding + scoring

- **Status**: Accepted (encode-side flags); HDR-VMAF scoring deferred (no fork-local model JSON yet)
- **Date**: 2026-05-03
- **Deciders**: Lusoris
- **Tags**: tooling, vmaf-tune, hdr, codec, ffmpeg, fork-local

## Context

`vmaf-tune` Phase A ([ADR-0237](0237-quality-aware-encode-automation.md))
landed an SDR-only grid sweep over `libx264` — the encode invocation
hardcoded BT.709 / gamma-2.4 assumptions and the score invocation
always pointed at `vmaf_v0.6.1` (an SDR-trained model). Bucket #9 of
the Phase A capability audit (Research-0054, the audit body of PR #354)
flagged this as a correctness hazard: feeding a PQ HDR source through
the existing pipeline produces (i) muxed encodes that lose their
mastering-display + max-CLL SEI metadata, and (ii) VMAF scores that
trend artificially low because the SDR model misinterprets the
PQ-coded luma curve.

HDR sources are identifiable from container metadata alone — ffprobe
surfaces `color_transfer` (`smpte2084` for PQ, `arib-std-b67` for HLG),
`color_primaries` (`bt2020`), and the optional mastering-display +
content-light SEI side data. Encoders accept HDR signaling via
codec-private flag families (x265 `-x265-params`, SVT-AV1
`-svtav1-params`, NVENC `-pix_fmt p010le -profile:v main10`,
container-level `-color_*` for everyone else). Netflix maintains an
HDR-trained VMAF model (`vmaf_hdr_v0.6.1.json`) in a separate
research artifact; it has not been ported into this fork.

The action surface for Bucket #9 is therefore split: the
encode-side flag dispatch is a pure refactor of how `vmaf-tune` builds
its ffmpeg argv, while the score-side HDR model swap is gated on a
fork-local port that is out of scope for this PR.

## Decision

We will:

1. Ship a `tools/vmaf-tune/src/vmaftune/hdr.py` module that exposes
   `detect_hdr(path) → HdrInfo | None`, `hdr_codec_args(encoder, info)
   → tuple[str, ...]`, and `select_hdr_vmaf_model() → Path | None`.
2. Wire detection into the corpus driver: when a source's first video
   stream carries PQ or HLG signaling **and** BT.2020 primaries, the
   per-source ffmpeg invocation gets the codec-appropriate HDR flags
   appended to `extra_params`, and the corpus row gains
   `hdr_transfer` / `hdr_primaries` / `hdr_forced` fields
   (schema bumped to v2).
3. Surface four mutually-exclusive CLI modes: `--auto-hdr` (default),
   `--force-sdr`, `--force-hdr-pq`, `--force-hdr-hlg`. The two
   `force-hdr-*` modes synthesise an `HdrInfo` without probing — useful
   for raw YUV reference clips that ffprobe can't carry color metadata
   for.
4. Resolve an HDR VMAF model JSON via `model/vmaf_hdr_*.json` glob
   when one is shipped; when none is found, log a one-shot warning
   and fall back to the configured SDR model. The model port itself
   is a follow-up backlog item; this PR ships the detection +
   resolution scaffolding so the swap is one file drop away.
5. Treat malformed HDR signaling (PQ/HLG transfer with non-BT.2020
   primaries) as SDR — misclassifying SDR as HDR is the dangerous
   failure mode (would inject mismatched primaries into a Rec.709
   encode); misclassifying HDR as SDR is recoverable (encode proceeds
   without HDR signaling, scores trend low, user re-runs with
   `--force-hdr-*`).

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detect HDR via libavformat / pyav inside the harness | No subprocess hop; richer side-data API | Adds a Python build dep; libavformat versioning becomes a vmaf-tune concern | ffprobe is already required for SDR pipelines; one more invocation per source is noise vs. the encode wall time |
| Per-codec HDR module under `codec_adapters/` (one HDR file per encoder) | Mirrors the codec-adapter pattern from ADR-0237 | Spreads the HDR contract across N files; flag families overlap heavily (every codec wants the global `-color_*` set) | A single dispatch table keeps the contract auditable in one file; codec-adapter PRs add their own row when they land |
| Skip detection, expose `--hdr-pq` / `--hdr-hlg` flags only | Simpler implementation | User has to read the source's metadata themselves; mixed-corpus runs (some HDR, some SDR sources) need per-source flags | Auto-detect is the demanded UX (`--auto-hdr` defaults true); manual override stays available via `--force-*` |
| Block on the HDR VMAF model port and ship encoding + scoring together | Single coherent PR | Indefinite delay — the model port is a Netflix-research artifact that needs ffmpeg-quality compliance review | Encoder-side correctness is independently valuable; landing it now unblocks corpus runs against HDR sources, scoring port becomes a one-file follow-up |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: HDR sources now produce muxed encodes that retain
  their color signaling; corpus rows record HDR provenance for Phase
  B / C consumers; the codec-adapter PRs (x265, SVT-AV1, NVENC,
  VVenC) inherit a working HDR dispatch the day they land.
- **Negative**: HDR scoring still uses the SDR model — the resulting
  `vmaf_score` values are not directly comparable to SDR scores from
  the same model and trend low for high-luminance regions. Schema v1
  consumers must be updated (the three new keys are additive, but
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped); existing corpus JSONLs remain readable
  but render `hdr_*` keys as missing.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**:
  - Port `vmaf_hdr_v0.6.1.json` from Netflix's HDR research artifact
    into `model/` (backlog item, gated on Netflix-license review).
  - x265 / SVT-AV1 codec adapters (Phase B+) inherit this dispatch
    table without modification — ADR-0235 (codec collision) /
    ADR-0237 (Phase ordering) are unchanged.
  - The schema-v2 row is documented at
    [`docs/usage/vmaf-tune.md` § HDR](../usage/vmaf-tune.md).
