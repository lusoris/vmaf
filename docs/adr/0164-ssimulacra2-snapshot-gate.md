# ADR-0164: SSIMULACRA 2 snapshot-JSON regression gate (T3-3)

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-04-24
- **Deciders**: Lusoris, Claude (Anthropic)
- **Tags**: test, ssimulacra2, regression-gate, fork-local

## Context

Backlog item T3-3 calls for a regression gate that catches unintended
drift in the fork's `ssimulacra2` feature extractor output. ADR-0130
deferred this gate with the note:

> Snapshot-comparison against `tools/ssimulacra2` ships as a follow-up PR
> (`ssimulacra2_rs` cargo install currently broken; Pacidus Python port
> github.com/Pacidus/ssimulacra2 remains a viable reference).
>
> This PR does not commit `testdata/scores_cpu_ssimulacra2.json`.

Three full SIMD ports later ([ADR-0161](0161-ssimulacra2-simd-bitexact.md),
[0162](0162-ssimulacra2-iir-blur-simd.md), [0163](0163-ssimulacra2-ptlr-simd.md))
closed T3-1 in full. Zero scalar hot paths remain. We have 15 bit-exact
unit tests pinning kernel-level behaviour. What we lacked: an
end-to-end integration gate pinning the whole-extractor output.

## Decision

Ship a fork-local Python integration test
[`python/test/ssimulacra2_test.py`](../../python/test/ssimulacra2_test.py)
that invokes the `vmaf` CLI with `--feature ssimulacra2` on two known
YUV fixtures (already checked in under `python/test/resource/yuv/`) and
asserts the per-frame + pooled scores against pinned floats with 4-place
tolerance.

Explicitly NOT chosen: cross-checking against `tools/ssimulacra2` (the
libjxl reference) or against the Pacidus Python port. Rationale:

- **libjxl `tools/ssimulacra2`** is not trivially installable in a CI
  image — requires a libjxl build from source, plus specific PNG / JXL
  codec dependencies. Adding this as a CI gate is a much bigger scope.
- **Pacidus Python port** has known discrepancies with the libjxl
  reference due to differences in the Gaussian blur implementation
  (scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter vs libjxl FastGaussian 3-pole IIR).
  The fork's scalar follows libjxl; any comparison would produce a
  bounded-but-nonzero delta, requiring a tolerance argument.

The self-consistency gate we ship here catches the practical concern:
unintended behaviour change inside the fork's own implementation
(e.g. a future SIMD port drifting from scalar, or a scalar refactor
breaking the libjxl-reference semantics). The pinned values were
generated on a CPU-only build at the current master HEAD.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fork-self-consistency gate via Python `unittest` subprocess + JSON + `assertAlmostEqual(places=4)` (this ADR)** | Simple; no new CI dependency; catches real drift; covers 2 fixtures × 48 frames = 96 scores | Doesn't cross-check against an independent reference | **Chosen** — closes T3-3's stated goal at minimal scope |
| **Gate against libjxl `tools/ssimulacra2`** | True third-party reference | Requires libjxl build + codec deps in CI; cargo install of `ssimulacra2_rs` is broken; bigger PR surface | Rejected — scope creep, environment fragility |
| **Gate against Pacidus Python reference** | Pure-Python; installable via pip | Known scalar-level drift vs libjxl FastGaussian IIR; requires a tolerance argument to mask the difference; muddles the "bit-exact within fork" story | Rejected — would pin the fork to a non-authoritative scalar path |
| **Ship only kernel-level SIMD tests, no integration gate** | Zero new test surface; rely on SIMD tests | Misses end-to-end integration regressions (e.g. extractor state init bug, YUV-matrix dispatch bug) | Rejected — the unit tests don't exercise the full pipeline including YUV → linear RGB → DCT scale pyramid → blur → mask → score pooling |

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Real regression gate on the ssimulacra2 extractor output. Any
    future change that drifts per-frame scores by more than 1e-4 is
    caught in the fork's standard Python test suite.
  - Uses the already-checked-in `src01_hrc00/hrc01_576x324.yuv` +
    `dis_test_0_1_..._q_160x90.yuv` fixtures. No new test data.
  - No new CI dependencies.
  - Closes backlog T3-3.
- **Negative**:
  - Not cross-checked against an independent reference. If libjxl
    changes their algorithm and we want to track, we'd need to
    manually re-sync + update the pinned values.
- **Cross-host reproducibility**:
  - Initial PR attempt used `places=4`. First CI run showed ~2e-4
    drift between the AVX-512 authoring host and the CI GCC/clang
    hosts — rooted in cross-host FMA-fusion differences (GCC 10+
    defaults `-ffp-contract=fast` when `-mfma` is on, and the
    per-lane libm `cbrtf` / `powf` calls live next to scalar glue
    that can fuse differently). Followed the ADR-0161 NEON
    precedent and split each ssimulacra2 source (scalar
    extractor + AVX2 + AVX-512 + NEON SIMD TUs) into dedicated
    static libs compiled with `-ffp-contract=off`. Pinned values
    are now stable across hosts and `places=4` holds.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**:
  - When libjxl releases a new SSIMULACRA 2 reference version or
    `ssimulacra2_rs` becomes installable again, a separate ADR could
    add a second, cross-reference gate.
  - The pinned values assume CPU dispatch. If anyone adds a CUDA or
    SYCL path for ssimulacra2 in the future (currently neither exists),
    the test would need `--no_cuda --no_sycl` flags appended or a
    split variant.

## Verification

- `python -m pytest test/ssimulacra2_test.py -v`:
  **2/2 pass** on the AVX-512 host.
- Values pinned against master HEAD `origin/master` post-merge of PR
  #100. Per-frame spot-checks included (frame 0 and frame 47).
