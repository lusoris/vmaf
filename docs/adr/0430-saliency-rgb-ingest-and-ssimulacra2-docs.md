# ADR-0430: Saliency RGB ingest and SSIMULACRA2 public docs

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-05-14
- **Deciders**: Lusoris, Codex
- **Tags**: vmaf-tune, saliency, docs, metrics, fork-local

## Context

The public-doc gap scan found two user-facing stale surfaces: the
SSIMULACRA2 metric page still called itself a stub even though scalar, SIMD,
and GPU implementations are in tree, and the `vmaf-tune` saliency section
still documented luma-replicated RGB as a deferred limitation.

The saliency student was trained for ImageNet-normalised RGB. Feeding luma
replicated into all channels is a defensible smoke path, but it discards
available chroma from the yuv420p source. The existing saliency pipeline
already accepts yuv420p input and has a NumPy preprocessing step, so the
implementation cost of nearest-neighbour chroma upsample plus BT.709
limited-range conversion is small.

## Decision

`vmaf-tune` saliency inference will read full yuv420p frames, upsample U/V to
luma resolution, convert BT.709 limited-range YUV to RGB, and then apply the
existing ImageNet normalisation before calling `saliency_student_v1`. The
SSIMULACRA2 public metric page will become an operator reference rather than a
stub index page.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keep luma-replicated RGB | Fastest and already tested | Leaves a documented deferred limitation in a user-facing saliency path; ignores colour cues the model can consume | Rejected |
| Convert yuv420p to RGB in the saliency preprocessor | Closes the deferred limitation; preserves the existing model contract; easy to test without ffmpeg | Slightly more CPU per sampled frame; chroma upsample remains nearest-neighbour | Chosen |
| Shell out to ffmpeg for RGB frames | Delegates colour conversion to a mature implementation | Adds a subprocess dependency to the hot saliency path and complicates tests | Rejected |
| Leave `docs/metrics/ssimulacra2.md` as a stub index | No code/docs churn | Contradicts the shipped implementation status and the doc sweep heuristic | Rejected |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Saliency ROI can use colour information from source clips, and
  users now get a direct SSIMULACRA2 reference page with invocation, output,
  input formats, backends, and limitations.
- **Negative**: Saliency preprocessing does a small amount of extra NumPy work
  per sampled frame.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: The saliency path still documents aggregate
  per-clip masks and nearest-neighbour chroma upsampling. Per-frame ROI remains
  separate future work.
