## Context

[ADR-0165](0165-state-md-bug-tracking.md) introduced
[`docs/state.md`](../state.md) and bound the update discipline to
**CLAUDE.md §12 rule 13** — every PR that closes, opens, or rules-out
a bug must update `docs/state.md` in the same PR (or carry the explicit
opt-out `no state delta: REASON`). Until now the rule has been
**reviewer-enforced**: the
[PR template](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) carries the
"Bug-status hygiene" checkbox, and reviewers were expected to verify it.

The state.md audit-backfill PR #455 (the manual sweep that retroactively
filled in months of missed rows) surfaced this as a backlog row: reviewer
attention is the wrong substrate for a mechanically-decidable predicate.
"Did the diff touch `docs/state.md`?" is a one-line `grep` against
`git diff --name-only`. "Does the PR body carry the opt-out?" is one more
`grep` against the body. The same check runs on every PR; humans miss it
intermittently. Mechanical enforcement frees reviewer attention for the
substantive parts of a PR.

The fork already has a precedent for this exact shape:
[ADR-0124](0124-automated-rule-enforcement.md) /
[`.github/workflows/rule-enforcement.yml`](../../.github/workflows/rule-enforcement.yml)
runs three jobs (deliverables, doc-substance, ADR-backfill) parsing the
PR body + diff with plain bash. ADR-0167 promoted doc-substance from
advisory to blocking once the predicate became precise enough. This ADR
follows the same trajectory for ADR-0165.

## Decision

Add a fourth job, `state-md-touch-check`, to
`.github/workflows/rule-enforcement.yml`, backed by a single-purpose
script `scripts/ci/state-md-touch-check.sh`. The script is **blocking**
(no `continue-on-error: true`), draft-PR-gated (matches the existing
jobs), and runs the same predicate locally and in CI.

**Trigger predicate** (any one suffices):

1. PR title carries a Conventional-Commit `fix:` / `fix(scope):`
   prefix.
2. PR title contains the bare token `bug` (word-boundary, so `debug`
   does not fire).
3. PR title or body contains a `closes #N` / `fixes #N` /
   `resolves #N` GitHub-issue close keyword.
4. PR body carries the `## Bug-status hygiene` template section with
   the `docs/state.md` checkbox left unchecked.

**Pass conditions** (either is enough):

1. The diff against `BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA` includes `docs/state.md`.
2. The PR body contains `no state delta: <REASON>` where REASON is a
   non-empty token that is not the literal placeholder `REASON`. HTML
   comments are stripped before the match so the template's
   instructional `<!-- ... no state delta: REASON ... -->` doesn't
   accidentally satisfy the gate.

**Failure mode**: print `::error title=ADR-0165 docs/state.md drift::`
naming the four section choices (Open / Recently closed / Confirmed
not-affected / Deferred) and the two ways to clear the gate.

A companion `scripts/ci/test-state-md-touch-check.sh` exercises the
script against eight fixture cases (5 primary + 3 regression). Tests
are bash-only and run in a throw-away `mktemp -d` git repo so the
diff input is real, not mocked.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Inline the bash in `rule-enforcement.yml` (current pattern for the doc-substance job)** | Zero indirection; one file to read | Cannot dry-run locally before `gh pr create`; doubles bash-in-YAML maintenance cost | Rejected — the existing `deliverables-check.sh` precedent shows the script-with-thin-wrapper shape is worth the extra file. Local dry-run saves one CI round-trip per "I forgot the opt-out" mistake. |
| **Keep the rule reviewer-enforced** | No new CI surface | Repeated drift across months (the audit-backfill PR exists because of this) | Rejected — the predicate is mechanically decidable; relying on reviewer attention is the wrong substrate. |
| **Promote to a non-bypassable required check via branch-protection** | Strongest enforcement | Hard to revert if the heuristic over-fires; legitimate `feat:` PRs would need to learn the opt-out before merging | Deferred — start as a regular blocking workflow. If false positives are rare after one month, promote to the `required-aggregator.yml` set in a follow-up PR. |
| **Use `danger.js` / a GitHub App for body parsing** | Richer DSL | Adds a Node runtime to a repo whose CI is bash + meson + Python; widens supply-chain surface for no functional gain | Rejected — same reasoning as ADR-0124 §"Why this design". |

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Mechanical enforcement of CLAUDE.md §12 rule 13 — no more drift
  across sessions.
- Local dry-run via `PR_TITLE=… PR_BODY=… scripts/ci/state-md-touch-check.sh`
  saves a CI round-trip.
- The eight fixture tests pin the trigger heuristic so regressions
  surface early (e.g. the `debug`-vs-`bug` distinction).
- Symmetry with `deliverables-check.sh` — a contributor who has
  internalised one gate already understands the other.

**Negative:**

- One more CI step on every PR (~15 s on `ubuntu-latest`).
- The trigger heuristic is necessarily a heuristic; a `feat:` PR
  that incidentally fixes a bug without a `fix:` prefix will not
  fire the gate (false negative). Mitigated by the
  Bug-status-hygiene checkbox in the template — copy-pasting the
  template carries the trigger-on-unchecked path.
- A `fix:` PR that legitimately has no bug-status delta (e.g.
  `fix: typo in log message`) needs the `no state delta: REASON`
  opt-out. The error message names this explicitly.

**Neutral / follow-ups:**

- After ~30 days, audit false-positive rate. If <5%, promote to
  `required-aggregator.yml`; if ≥5%, tighten the trigger predicate.
- Monitor for cases where the literal `REASON` placeholder slips
  through despite the all-caps guard — escalate to a stricter
  "lowercase prose required" regex if needed.

### Status update 2026-05-09: placeholder-ref hardening

PR #541's comprehensive `docs/state.md` row audit
([Research-0090](../research/0090-state-md-row-audit-2026-05-09.md))
surfaced a drift mode the original gate does not catch. Of 41
"Recently closed" sub-rows audited, 8 were stale because the
closer-PR field still read the placeholder `this PR` (a literal
the closing PR's branch wrote before merge), never rewritten to
the merged numeric PR after squash-merge. The original gate only
checks that the diff *touches* `docs/state.md`; it does not check
that newly-added rows cite a real merged PR or commit SHA.

Per user direction 2026-05-09, this status update extends
[`scripts/ci/state-md-touch-check.sh`](../../scripts/ci/state-md-touch-check.sh)
with an additional check on the unified diff of `docs/state.md`:
inserted lines (lines starting with `+`, excluding the `+++ b/...`
header) must not contain any of the following placeholder forms:

- `this PR` (case-insensitive, whitespace-bounded — covers
  `(this PR)`, `this PR (branch, date)`)
- `this commit` (case-insensitive, whitespace-bounded)
- bare `TBD` (case-insensitive, word-boundary)
- the literal `<PR>` (template placeholder)
- the literal `#NNN` (template placeholder; real PR refs use
  digits, e.g. `#432`)

Canonical accept forms — explicitly NOT matched — are `PR #N`
(any positive integer) and ``commit `<sha>` ``. The failure
message points at the offending lines and names the canonical
replacement: "rewrite as `PR #N (commit \`<sha>\`)` before
squash-merge".

The fixture script gains 10 additional cases (8 reject + 2
accept) covering each placeholder form plus two regression cases:
(a) the placeholder must NOT match when it appears only on
*removed* lines (the gate's job is to police what *enters*
state.md, not what is being cleaned up); (b) substrings like
`debug-pr` (no whitespace between `this` and `pr`) must not
match. Total fixture-script cases: 18 (5 primary + 3 regression
+ 10 placeholder-ref).

The hardening is *additive*: every existing pass / fail case from
the 2026-05-08 ADR remains unchanged. Per
`feedback_no_test_weakening`, none of the original 8 fixture
assertions were relaxed.

Bypass: standard CI exit-1 (the user can edit + push again).
There is intentionally no opt-out sentinel for the placeholder
check — a state.md row referring to "this PR" is *always* a
post-merge drift hazard, regardless of PR shape.

For an in-flight PR whose number is not yet final, the gate
clears via either of two approved paths:

1. Land the row with a placeholder, push a follow-up commit
   rewriting it to `PR #<number>` after `gh pr create` returns
   the number.
2. Use `PR #<this-pr-number>` once GitHub has assigned it (the
   PR number is known the moment `gh pr create` exits).
