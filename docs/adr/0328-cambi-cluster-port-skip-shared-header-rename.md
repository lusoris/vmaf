## Context

Netflix upstream landed a 10-commit cambi cluster between 2026-05-06 and
2026-05-07 (`d655cefe` … `41bacc83`). The lusoris fork ports nine of these
commits verbatim. The tenth — `41bacc83` "feature/cambi: move shared code to
cambi.h" — relocates the shared inline helpers (`update_histogram_*`,
`uh_slide`, `uh_slide_edge`, `MAX`/`MIN`, `VmafRangeUpdater` typedef, the
`reciprocal_lut` LUT) and the `MAX/MIN` macros from `cambi.c` into a new
`libvmaf/src/feature/cambi.h` (renaming `cambi_reciprocal_lut.h` to it). It
also moves `calculate_c_values_avx2` from `cambi.c` into
`libvmaf/src/feature/x86/cambi_avx2.c`, since that function now needs the
shared helpers too.

The fork's port of `933cccb4` (frame-level calc_c_values dispatch) introduced
a `CAMBI_CALC_C_VALUES_BODY` macro inside `cambi.c` so the three driver
variants — scalar `calculate_c_values`, `calculate_c_values_avx2`, and a
fork-specific `calculate_c_values_neon` — share their loop nest verbatim
while binding to ISA-specific updaters at compile time. With the macro in
place, the helper inlines never need to be visible outside `cambi.c`, so
the upstream rename has no fork-side benefit.

The fork also has a separate `libvmaf/src/feature/cambi_internal.h` whose
purpose is ABI-stable shim functions for the Vulkan twin (ADR-0205 Strategy
II). Adopting upstream's `cambi.h` would create a second cambi public-ish
header file with overlapping responsibilities, which is exactly the kind of
collision the ADR-0028 maintenance rule warns against.

## Decision

We accept the cluster port as 9-of-10 commits and explicitly **skip
`41bacc83`**. The fork's `CAMBI_CALC_C_VALUES_BODY` macro stays in
`cambi.c`; `cambi_reciprocal_lut.h` is not renamed; no new `cambi.h` is
introduced. The fork-internal `cambi_internal.h` remains the only "shared
cambi inline" header.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: Apply 41bacc83 verbatim** (rename `cambi_reciprocal_lut.h` → `cambi.h`, move helpers, move `calculate_c_values_avx2` into `cambi_avx2.c`, move a fork-added `calculate_c_values_neon` into `arm64/cambi_neon.c`) | Maximal rebase friendliness; identical layout to upstream. | Requires deleting the fork's `CAMBI_CALC_C_VALUES_BODY` macro (regression on dispatch DRYness for the 3-variant fork). Adds a second cambi header alongside `cambi_internal.h` — confusing co-existence. NEON `arm64/cambi_neon.c` would need to grow `calculate_c_values_neon`, expanding the fork-specific surface. | Drops a working DRY abstraction for marginal upstream-mirror gain. |
| **B: Skip 41bacc83 entirely** *(chosen)* | Preserves the macro DRY dispatch; no header collision; minimal diff churn. | Future cambi syncs that touch the moved helpers will need fork-side adaptation (same as today). | Documented as an intentional partial port with a tracking entry in `docs/rebase-notes.md`. |
| C: Apply only the rename (`cambi_reciprocal_lut.h` → `cambi.h`), keep helpers in `cambi.c` | File-name parity with upstream. | The point of the rename in 41bacc83 is to give the helpers a home — without that, the rename is pure churn. | Half-measure with no payoff. |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: cambi.c stays self-contained for the inline helpers; the
  macro-based 3-variant dispatch keeps the inc/dec/row triples in one place;
  no new cambi.h conflicts with `cambi_internal.h`.
- **Negative**: any future upstream cambi commit that depends on the
  cambi.h location (e.g. a future ISA shim including `cambi.h` to reuse
  `update_histogram_*`) will need fork-side translation to the macro. The
  rebase-notes entry tracks this.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: tracked in
  [`docs/rebase-notes.md`](../rebase-notes.md) under
  `RN-2026-05-08-cambi-cluster`. If a future port introduces a need for
  cross-TU access to the helpers, we revisit by promoting the helpers to a
  fork-local `cambi_inlines.h` (separate from both `cambi_internal.h` and
  upstream's `cambi.h`).

## Status update 2026-05-08: SIMD twins completed

The two perf follow-ups tracked in `RN-2026-05-08-cambi-cluster` —
`calculate_c_values_row_avx512` and `calculate_c_values_row_neon` — both
landed alongside this status update. Both implementations preserve
bit-exactness vs. the scalar reference at full IEEE-754 precision (gated
by the new `libvmaf/test/test_cambi_simd.c` parity test, which compares
scalar / AVX-2 / AVX-512 / NEON outputs byte-for-byte). The
`CAMBI_CALC_C_VALUES_BODY` macro picked up two new ISA-bound dispatch
points (`calculate_c_values_avx512`, the upgraded
`calculate_c_values_neon`) without restructuring; the macro stays the
single source of truth for the loop nest.

End-to-end behaviour is unchanged: Netflix golden gate scores are
byte-identical to the AVX-2 baseline (verified via
`vmaf --precision max` on the src01 pair). Microbenchmark shows
AVX-512 ~1.15× over AVX-2 on AMD Zen 5 (gather-bound; Intel parts
expected to land closer to 1.5-2× per the
[ADR-0328 §References / cambi.md SIMD section](../metrics/cambi.md#cpu-simd-paths)).
NEON timing is host-dependent and exercised by the parity test only.

The decision in this ADR (skip `41bacc83`, keep the macro) is unchanged
— the new twins consume the existing macro and confirm the macro is the
right shape for an N-variant fork dispatch table.
