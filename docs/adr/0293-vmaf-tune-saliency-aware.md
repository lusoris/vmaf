## Context

The fork ships two saliency surfaces today: `mobilesal` /
`saliency_student_v1` as a libvmaf feature extractor (scoring side,
ADR-0218 / ADR-0286), and `vmaf-roi` as a C sidecar binary that
emits per-CTU QP-offset files for x265 / SVT-AV1 (encoder side,
ADR-0247). Bucket #2 of the PR #354 audit calls for a *third*
surface: the same saliency signal exposed through the
[`vmaf-tune`](../usage/vmaf-tune.md) Python harness so a single
command can produce a saliency-biased encode end-to-end.

The umbrella decision (ADR-0237) carved `vmaf-tune` into six phases.
Phase A (the grid-corpus scaffold, PR #329) shipped the codec
adapter contract, the JSONL row schema, and the subprocess seam.
Bucket #2 is a tactical add-on inside Phase A's footprint — a
`recommend` subcommand and a `saliency.py` module — that does not
require Phase B (target-VMAF bisect). The `recommend` flag surface
is wired so Phase B can swap in a true bisect later without renaming
flags.

The fork-trained `saliency_student_v1` weights (ADR-0286, PR #359)
ship under BSD-3-Clause-Plus-Patent and unblock this work — earlier
attempts to source MobileSal upstream weights were blocked by
license incompatibility (ADR-0257).

## Decision

We will add `tools/vmaf-tune/src/vmaftune/saliency.py` and a new
`vmaf-tune recommend` CLI subcommand that:

1. Computes a per-clip aggregate saliency mask from
   `saliency_student_v1.onnx` over a sampled set of frames.
2. Maps the mask to a per-pixel QP-offset map clamped to ±12 (matching
   `vmaf-roi`'s ADR-0247 convention).
3. Reduces to per-MB granularity (16×16 luma) for x264 `--qpfile`.
4. Runs a single ffmpeg encode with the qpfile injected via
   `-x264-params qpfile=…`.

The model is loaded lazily and is **optional**: missing
onnxruntime / missing weights logs a warning and falls back to a
plain encode so the harness always returns a result. All numeric
kernels (RGB conversion, ImageNet normalisation, per-MB reduce,
QP clamp) are pure NumPy so the test suite runs without
onnxruntime; the ONNX session is mocked via a `session_factory`
seam, mirroring the existing subprocess seam in `encode.py` /
`score.py`.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shell out to the existing `vmaf-roi` C binary | Reuses ADR-0247 wiring; one source of truth for the saliency→QP math; immediately covers x265 + SVT-AV1 | Requires a built libvmaf tree on PATH; binary is one-frame-per-invocation today (Wave 1 deliberately) so per-clip aggregate would need a per-frame loop in Python *plus* a separate aggregation step; harder to mock in tests | Wave-2 follow-up: once `vmaf-roi` grows a batch mode (roadmap §2.3), the Python helper can delegate. For Bucket #2 a self-contained Python path is cheaper to ship and test. |
| Pure-Python ONNX inference (chosen) | Zero binary dependency on `vmaf-roi`; clean test-seam (mocked session); same numeric pipeline as the C side | Duplicates the saliency→QP math (small: ~5 lines numpy); needs `onnxruntime` at runtime; today only emits x264 qpfile | Selected — graceful fallback covers the missing-onnxruntime case; codec coverage extends one file per encoder under `codec_adapters/` without touching the search loop. |
| Bake saliency into the existing `corpus` subcommand | One subcommand, no API growth | Conflates "sweep a grid" with "produce a recommended encode"; corpus rows would gain a saliency-on/off bool that downstream Phase B/C would have to special-case | The `recommend` subcommand is the right layer — Phase B's target-VMAF bisect will land here too. |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: end-to-end saliency-aware encoding becomes a single
  command (`vmaf-tune recommend --saliency-aware`); no manual
  per-frame qpfile orchestration required. The `recommend` flag
  surface is now stable for Phase B's bisect drop-in.
- **Positive**: Bucket #2 of the PR #354 audit is closed without
  blocking on `vmaf-roi` Wave-2 batch mode.
- **Negative**: a small numeric duplication of the saliency→QP map
  with `vmaf-roi`'s C implementation. Both clamp to ±12 with a
  signed `centred = 2*sal − 1` linear blend, so the bit-for-bit
  contract is one assertion in `test_saliency.py`.
- **Negative**: x264-only in this PR. x265 / SVT-AV1 inherit
  `vmaf-roi`'s sidecar today and will get the `vmaf-tune recommend`
  variant in a one-file follow-up (`codec_adapters/x265.py` +
  qpfile formatter).
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: Phase B (target-VMAF bisect) replaces
  the explicit-CRF default with a real bisect; Phase C (per-shot
  CRF predictor) consumes per-frame saliency rather than
  per-clip aggregate; integration coverage with a real ffmpeg +
  real model lands when the codec adapter set widens.

### Status update 2026-05-08: codec extension

The original ADR closed Bucket #2 with x264-only ROI support and
flagged x265 / SVT-AV1 / VVenC as a "one-file follow-up". That
follow-up has now landed. `saliency_aware_encode()` dispatches on a
new `qpfile_format` field on the codec-adapter Protocol and hands
each codec the ROI sidecar shape it actually accepts on disk:

| Codec | `qpfile_format` | Encoder surface | Block size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `libx264` | `x264-mb` | `-x264-params qpfile=…` | 16×16 (MB) |
| `libx265` | `x265-zones` | `-x265-params zones=…` | 64×64 (CTU), aggregated to clip mean |
| `libsvtav1` | `svtav1-roi` | `-svtav1-params roi-map-file=…` | 64×64 (SB) |
| `libvvenc` | `vvenc-qp-delta` | `-vvenc-params QpaperROIFile=…` | 128×128 (CTU) |
| HW codecs / `libaom-av1` | `none` | — | plain encode + warning |

x265 is a deliberate granularity loss: the ffmpeg libx265 wrapper
exposes only the temporal `zones=` syntax, so the per-CTU saliency
map is reduced to a single clip-level mean QP offset. Users who
require true per-CTU x265 ROI continue to drive the C-side
[`vmaf-roi`](../usage/vmaf-roi.md) sidecar (ADR-0247), whose
`--qpfile`-style x265 emitter is unchanged. SVT-AV1's binary format
is byte-for-byte identical to `vmaf-roi`'s `emit_svtav1` helper
(pinned by a regression test), so the two surfaces produce the same
ROI map for the same saliency input.

The amendment does not change the original decision; it extends the
codec coverage along the dispatch seam the original architecture
left open. User docs landed at
[`docs/usage/vmaf-tune-saliency.md`](../usage/vmaf-tune-saliency.md);
