## Context

The Metal backend runtime (ADR-0420 / T8-1b) and the first eight
feature kernels (ADR-0421 / T8-1c–j) are live: a caller that hands
libvmaf a software `VmafPicture` can already score it on an Apple
Silicon GPU via the `--backend metal` / `metal_device=` CLI surfaces
(ADR-0422). The remaining gap is the FFmpeg hwdec zero-copy path —
VideoToolbox-decoded `AVFrame`s arrive as
`AV_PIX_FMT_VIDEOTOOLBOX` with `data[3] -> CVPixelBufferRef`, and the
only way to feed them into libvmaf today is the
`hwdownload,format=nv12` round-trip the regular `libvmaf` filter
forces. That defeats the unified-memory zero-copy posture
ADR-0420 paid for on Apple Silicon: every frame round-trips
GPU→host→GPU through `vmaf_picture_alloc` even though the
IOSurface backing the source `CVPixelBufferRef` was already
addressable from any Apple-Family-7 `MTLDevice`.

The Vulkan flavour solved the symmetric problem in
[ADR-0184](0184-vulkan-image-import-scaffold.md) (scaffold) +
[ADR-0186](0186-vulkan-image-import-impl.md) (impl): caller-supplied
`VkImage` handles, an external-init entry point that adopts FFmpeg's
`VkDevice` so the source images are valid on libvmaf's compute device,
plus a dedicated `libvmaf_vulkan` filter
(`ffmpeg-patches/0006-libvmaf-add-libvmaf-vulkan-filter.patch`)
shipping the consumer side. We want the same shape for Metal so the
FFmpeg integration story stays uniform.

Three constraints push the work into an audit-first scaffold (this
ADR) rather than a single all-in-one PR:

1. The C-API surface — `vmaf_metal_state_init_external`,
   `vmaf_metal_picture_import`, `vmaf_metal_wait_compute`,
   `vmaf_metal_read_imported_pictures` — is what the ffmpeg patch
   consumes via `check_pkg_config`. CLAUDE.md §12 r14 requires
   the C-API and the matching `ffmpeg-patches/000*-*.patch` to land
   in the same PR, so the scaffold pins the symbol names before the
   filter body relies on them.
2. The runtime wiring
   (`[id<MTLDevice> newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:]`,
   `CVMetalTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImage`, per-plane texture
   reuse) is a non-trivial obj-c++ TU best reviewed on its own — the
   Vulkan precedent took two ADRs for exactly that reason.
3. The FFmpeg side has no `AVMetalDeviceContext` yet (no upstream
   patch as of n8.1.1); the dedicated filter has to pick a sensible
   default device until the upstream context lands. Decoupling the
   stub-API PR from the runtime PR keeps the FFmpeg patch reviewable
   in isolation while we wait on upstream.

## Decision

Land the IOSurface import path as a two-phase rollout mirroring the
Vulkan precedent:

- **T8-IOS (this ADR, accepted now)** — audit-first scaffold. Public
  `libvmaf_metal.h` gains `VmafMetalExternalHandles`,
  `vmaf_metal_state_init_external`, `vmaf_metal_picture_import`,
  `vmaf_metal_wait_compute`, and `vmaf_metal_read_imported_pictures`.
  Every entry point lives in a dedicated TU
  (`libvmaf/src/metal/picture_import.mm`) that returns -ENOSYS until
  the impl PR replaces it. The matching ffmpeg patch
  (`ffmpeg-patches/0013-libvmaf-add-libvmaf-metal-filter.patch`)
  registers a `libvmaf_metal` filter, consumes VideoToolbox
  `AVFrame`s, pulls IOSurfaces via `CVPixelBufferGetIOSurface`, and
  fails fast at `config_props` time when the runtime reports -ENOSYS
  — the same posture the Vulkan filter held between ADR-0184 and
  ADR-0186.

- **T8-IOS-b (follow-up, deferred)** — implementation PR. Replaces
  the `-ENOSYS` returns in `picture_import.mm` with the
  `MTLTextureDescriptor` + `newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:`
  wiring, materialises a `CVMetalTextureCache` for biplanar / triplanar
  layouts (NV12 / P010), wires the per-frame synchronisation barrier
  through the existing `kernel_template` `MTLSharedEvent` pair, and
  drops the `-ENOSYS` fail-fast branch from the filter.

The scaffold pattern is identical to ADR-0184 → ADR-0186; reviewers
can read the two changes back-to-back.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single PR carrying API + filter + runtime + tests | One review, no -ENOSYS dead-code path. | Mixes 3 review domains (C-API, FFmpeg, obj-c++); ADR-0184 precedent shows two-phase reviews catch design issues earlier. | Rejected — Vulkan's two-phase rollout caught the same-device constraint at scaffold time (would have wasted a full impl pass to discover post-hoc). |
| Skip the dedicated filter, extend the regular `libvmaf` filter to consume IOSurfaces when `metal_device >= -1` and input is VideoToolbox | One filter, fewer config knobs. | Couples the metal_device option to a specific hwaccel input format; breaks pixfmt negotiation for the software path (regular `libvmaf` filter expects `AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P` etc.); diverges from Vulkan / SYCL precedent which uses dedicated filters per hwdec. | Rejected — uniformity with `libvmaf_sycl` / `libvmaf_vulkan` wins. |
| Defer the entire surface until FFmpeg ships `AVMetalDeviceContext` | Avoids the "pick default MTLDevice" hack at `config_props_metal`. | Upstream has no public timeline; we'd block the whole IOSurface story on something we don't control. Single-GPU Apple Silicon Macs (the common case) don't need the device-match guarantee anyway. | Rejected — the default-device pick is a documented limitation with a clean upgrade path. |
| Use `CVMetalTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImage` directly (no IOSurface extraction) | One Apple API instead of two. | The cache requires a `CVPixelBufferRef`; works on macOS but couples libvmaf to CoreVideo. Direct `newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:` keeps the C API IOSurface-only and lets non-CoreVideo callers (e.g. ScreenCaptureKit, AVPlayer hooks) import frames too. | Rejected for the public surface; the impl TU may still use the cache internally for biplanar layouts where descriptor chains are cumbersome. |

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Symbol parity with the Vulkan import path: identical entry-point
    shape, lifetime model, and same-device contract.
  - The FFmpeg filter ships now and starts surfacing usage / option
    feedback before the runtime lands. Reviewers can validate the
    user-facing CLI without waiting on obj-c++ review.
  - Lawrence's tap (`lusoris/homebrew-tap`) gets the matching
    `--enable-libvmaf-metal-filter` activation in a separate
    follow-up commit; this scaffold doesn't change the tap.

- **Negative**:
  - One -ENOSYS contract added to the public API surface. Users on
    libvmaf ≥ this ADR who try `ffmpeg -vf libvmaf_metal=...` get a
    fail-fast error pointing at this ADR. Documented; same posture
    Vulkan held between ADR-0184 and ADR-0186.
  - `config_props_metal` picks a default MTLDevice until FFmpeg
    exposes `AVMetalDeviceContext`. Multi-GPU Mac Pro hosts may pick
    the wrong device; tracked as a T8-IOS-b follow-up.

- **Neutral / follow-ups**:
  - T8-IOS-b: replace `picture_import.mm` stubs with the
    `MTLTextureDescriptor` wiring; drop the -ENOSYS branch in
    `config_props_metal`.
  - Tap: add `--enable-libvmaf-metal-filter` to `Formula/ffmpeg.rb`
    when T8-IOS-b lands (this PR doesn't activate the filter on
    Homebrew because the runtime returns -ENOSYS).
  - Smoke test: extend `libvmaf/test/test_metal_smoke.c` with a
    `-ENOSYS` contract assertion on the four new entry points;
    flipped to a green assertion in T8-IOS-b.
  - GPU-parity gate: no impact — the filter calls the same scoring
    pipeline as the software path, so cross-backend tolerances
    apply unchanged once T8-IOS-b lands.
