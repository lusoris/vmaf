# ADR-0118: FFmpeg patches ship as ordered series.txt, not a single carry

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-04-18
- **Deciders**: Lusoris, Claude (Anthropic)
- **Tags**: ci, build, ffmpeg, docker, sycl, ai

## Context

The fork ships three FFmpeg patches against `n8.1`:

1. `0001-libvmaf-add-tiny-model-option.patch` — adds `tiny_model`, `tiny_device`,
   `tiny_threads`, `tiny_fp16` options to `vf_libvmaf` (wires the tiny-AI surface
   from libvmaf's DNN runtime into the existing filter).
2. `0002-add-vmaf_pre-filter.patch` — adds a brand-new `vf_vmaf_pre.c` filter
   that runs a residual-CNN ONNX model via `vmaf_dnn_session_*`.
3. `0003-libvmaf-wire-sycl-backend-selector.patch` — adds `sycl_device` /
   `sycl_profile` options that route the filter through libvmaf's SYCL backend.

Patch 0003 references LIBVMAFContext fields added by 0001, so the series has a
**hard ordering**. Until this PR the build chain ignored that:

- `Dockerfile:86-88` `COPY`'d only `0003-libvmaf-wire-sycl-backend-selector.patch`
  and applied it standalone — failed at hunk 2 because `tiny_device` etc. were
  unknown identifiers.
- `.github/workflows/ffmpeg.yml:115-126` referenced a stale path
  `../patches/ffmpeg-libvmaf-sycl.patch` that no longer existed (the patches
  moved to `ffmpeg-patches/` weeks ago).
- All three patch files lacked the `index <sha>..<sha> <mode>` header line that
  `git apply` and `patch -p1` require, because they were hand-stubbed with
  placeholder SHAs (`a1a1a1…`, `b2b2b2…`, `c3c3c3…`) instead of being
  produced by `git format-patch`.

PR #50 surfaced all three problems simultaneously the moment its consolidated
master-targeting trigger matrix sent the docker / FFmpeg-SYCL jobs through the
gate for the first time on this branch.

## Decision

**We will treat `ffmpeg-patches/` as a managed quilt-style series, applied in
the order recorded in `ffmpeg-patches/series.txt`.** The Dockerfile and the
`ffmpeg.yml` workflow now both walk `series.txt` in order and apply each patch
via `git apply` with a `patch -p1` fallback. The patches themselves are
regenerated via real `git format-patch -3` runs against an FFmpeg `n8.1`
worktree, so they carry valid `index` lines and committable SHAs.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apply only 0003 (status quo before this PR) | Smallest CI surface. | tiny-AI and `vf_vmaf_pre` never reach a docker FFmpeg build; 0003 fails to apply standalone because it depends on 0001's struct fields. | Broken — chosen approach is the only one that compiles. |
| Squash all three patches into one mega-patch | Single `git apply`, no ordering risk. | Loses the per-feature commit message + signed-off-by trail; harder to upstream piecemeal; harder to diff what's a Lusoris addition vs. an FFmpeg change. | Future upstreaming pressure (each of the three is a sensible standalone PR target). |
| Maintain a permanent `lusoris-fork` branch on a vendored FFmpeg checkout | Always green; no patch fragility. | Doubles repo size; rebases on every FFmpeg release become a manual chore; breaks the "patches against tagged release" provenance story. | Operational cost too high for a 3-patch series. |
| Switch to Quilt or StGit for in-tree patch management | Industry-standard ordering tooling. | New dev dependency; extra learning curve for one-off contributors; CI runners would need the tool installed. | series.txt + plain `git apply` already gives us 90% of Quilt with zero new tools. |
| Convert each patch to an upstream FFmpeg PR and pin the merge SHAs | No carry burden long-term. | tiny-AI / vmaf_pre depend on libvmaf 3.0+ APIs that aren't yet released; FFmpeg upstream won't take patches against unreleased deps. | Premature — revisit once libvmaf 3.x ships. |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: docker image and CI FFmpeg-SYCL build now exercise the full
  fork-added FFmpeg surface (tiny-AI + `vmaf_pre` + SYCL selector), not just
  SYCL. Patch ordering is documented in one file (`series.txt`) and enforced
  by both Dockerfile and CI. Patches carry real SHAs so they round-trip
  through `git format-patch` / `git am` for anyone wanting to upstream them.
- **Negative**: every new patch must be appended to `series.txt` and respect
  the existing ordering; CI failures from a missing entry will surface late
  (only at the docker / FFmpeg-SYCL job, ~10 min in). The hard ordering
  between 0001 and 0003 is implicit — no static check enforces "0003 must
  come after 0001".
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: when libvmaf 3.0 ships, revisit option E (upstream
  the patches). `ffmpeg-patches/test/build-and-run.sh` already loops over
  series.txt the same way — Dockerfile and ffmpeg.yml now match its
  contract. No rebase impact (the patches target FFmpeg n8.1, not the fork).
