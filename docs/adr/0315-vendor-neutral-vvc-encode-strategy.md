# ADR-0315: Vendor-neutral VVC encode strategy — tiered Tier-1-now / Tier-2-backlog / Tier-3-revisit

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2026-05-05

- **Tags**: codecs, vvc, h266, gpu, hip, sycl, vulkan-video, vmaf-tune, nn-vc, fork-local

## Context

The fork ships VVC (H.266) encode today through a CPU-only adapter
([`tools/vmaf-tune/src/vmaftune/codec_adapters/vvenc.py`](../../tools/vmaf-tune/src/vmaftune/codec_adapters/vvenc.py))
that wraps Fraunhofer HHI's reference encoder.

**Verified at write time** (2026-05-05, WebFetch of NVIDIA's NVENC
Application Note for Video Codec SDK 13.0): NVENC supports
**only H.264, HEVC 8-bit, HEVC 10-bit, AV1 8-bit, AV1 10-bit**.
There is **no H.266/VVC encode** in any documented NVENC version.
AMD AMF and Intel QSV silicon support claims are `[UNVERIFIED]` in
Research-0085 (skeleton); indicative search suggests the same
("no shipping hardware VVC encode on any vendor in 2026"), but the
specific shipping-version capability checks have not been re-run for
this ADR.

The user (lawrence, 2026-05-05) asked whether a GPU-accelerated
VVC encode path that does not require NVIDIA hardware is feasible.
The honest answer today: **no vendor ships hardware VVC encode**, so
the question reduces to "which non-NVIDIA-tied software encoder +
GPU-accelerated tooling around it can the fork integrate".

Research-0085 (skeleton) surveyed the landscape and identified four
candidate paths: (a) wait for some vendor to ship hardware VVC
encode silicon (passive), (b) HIP-port VVenC's hot kernels
(open-source software acceleration; eng-months `[UNVERIFIED]`,
vendor-coverage AMD), (c) wait for Vulkan Video
`VK_KHR_video_encode_h266` ratification + driver landing (~24+
months out, `[UNVERIFIED]` whether even provisional today), or (d)
document NN-VC + the existing Vulkan **scoring** backend as the
de-facto vendor-neutral story today.

Forces:

- **Power of 10 / scope discipline** — the fork has limited engineering
  bandwidth; a 6-month HIP-port commitment crowds out tiny-AI and
  Vulkan-scoring backlog items.
- **Demand-pull principle** — fork-local efforts only ship when a
  user reports the gap as binding (precedent:
  [ADR-0009](0009-batch-a-upstream-port-strategy.md)).
- **Hardware availability** — the fork's CI matrix does not include
  RDNA 3/4 or Intel PVC nodes; a HIP port without a CI gate cannot
  satisfy [ADR-0214](0214-cross-backend-numerical-parity.md)'s
  GPU-parity rule.
- **Vendor-neutrality value** — non-NVIDIA users today have *zero*
  GPU acceleration on the VVC encode side; the gap is real, not
  theoretical.

## Decision

We will adopt a three-tier strategy. **Tier 1 ships today**:
document NN-VC as the fork's vendor-neutral H.266 GPU story (it
already runs on any ONNXRuntime EP) and wire the existing Vulkan
backend to `vmaf-tune` for GPU-accelerated scoring of CPU-encoded
VVC bitstreams (sibling [ADR-0314](0314-vmaf-tune-vulkan-score-quick-win.md),
scoped separately). **Tier 2 stays in the backlog**: a HIP port of
VVenC's motion-estimation, transform, and loop-filter kernels, gated
on three triggers (user-reported throughput pain on a real corpus,
Tier-1 NN-VC docs adopted in production, RDNA 3/4 or PVC CI machine
available). **Tier 3 is revisited quarterly**: a
`VK_KHR_video_encode_h266`-based libvmaf-side encode adapter, gated on
Khronos ratification and at least one shipping driver implementation.

Research-0085 is the authoritative source survey; this ADR is the
decision artifact that points back to it.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Ship CUDA-VVC NVENC adapter** (mirror [ADR-0290](0290-vmaf-tune-nvenc-adapters.md) for h266) | Would help RTX-40 users **if NVENC supported H.266**; reuses adapter ladder pattern | **Verified false premise**: NVENC SDK 13.0 supports only H.264 / HEVC / AV1 (no H.266 encode). There is no `h266_nvenc` to wire up. | **Rejected** as factually impossible at write time. Re-evaluate if NVIDIA ships VVC encode silicon in a future SDK. |
| **B. Wait for `VK_KHR_video_encode_h266` ratification** | Zero effort; eventually delivers vendor-neutral hardware encode on every Vulkan 1.4+ driver; reuses the fork's existing Vulkan loader / queue / DMABUF plumbing | Spec ratification status `[UNVERIFIED]`; AV1 precedent suggests multi-month spec-to-driver lag; abandons users who need a non-NVIDIA path **today** | Rejected as a standalone strategy. Reframed as Tier 3 (revisit quarterly) inside the chosen tiered approach. |
| **C. HIP port of VVenC hot kernels (immediate)** | Vendor-neutral on AMD silicon; precedent for fork-side GPU ports exists ([ADR-0033](0033-hip-applicability.md)) | Eng-months `[UNVERIFIED]`; rebase burden against vvenc's release cadence; no CI hardware available; no demand signal yet beyond the question itself | Rejected as immediate Tier 1; queued as Tier 2 with explicit demand-pull triggers. |
| **D. Tiered approach (chosen)** | Ships *something* vendor-neutral today (NN-VC docs + Vulkan scoring); preserves option value on the HIP port without burning engineering hours speculatively; revisits Vulkan Video on a calendar | Communicates "no GPU vendor ships VVC encode silicon in 2026; we mitigate via NN-VC + Vulkan scoring"; relies on CPU encode for near-term throughput | **Chosen.** Matches the fork's demand-pull pattern; gives users an honest answer + a non-zero GPU contribution (NN-VC + scoring) immediately; preserves room for Tier 2 / Tier 3 to arrive when triggers fire. |
| **E. ZLUDA-hosted hypothetical CUDA-VVC** | In theory runs CUDA codecs on AMD/Intel | No open-source CUDA VVC encoder exists; ZLUDA codec-workload coverage `[UNVERIFIED]`; reviewers would reasonably reject the production posture | Rejected as not actionable. |

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - User question answered honestly today: NN-VC + Vulkan scoring
    deliver the vendor-neutral GPU contribution that exists in 2026.
  - Engineering bandwidth preserved for tiny-AI / Vulkan-scoring
    backlog rather than committed to a 6-month HIP port without a
    demand signal.
  - Tier 2 / Tier 3 stay tracked in the backlog with explicit
    triggers, preventing them from being silently forgotten.
- **Negative**:
  - **No** users — NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel — get *hardware* VVC encode
    acceleration in the near term; no GPU vendor ships VVC encode
    silicon in 2026 per write-time verification (NVIDIA SDK 13.0
    docs) and indicative search for AMD / Intel. The only real
    levers are NN-VC quality (any-GPU) and CPU SIMD throughput.
  - The fork's "vendor-neutral codec story" is partial — strong on
    AV1 and HEVC (NVENC + AMF + QSV adapters all exist), weaker on
    H.266 (no GPU vendor ships VVC encode hardware).
- **Neutral / follow-ups**:
  - **No** `h266_nvenc` adapter follow-up is planned: NVENC silicon
    does not ship VVC encode at write time. If NVIDIA adds it in a
    future SDK, an analogue of [ADR-0290](0290-vmaf-tune-nvenc-adapters.md)
    would land then.
  - Tier 2 trigger conditions live in Research-0085 §"Tier-1 → Tier-2
    transition gate"; reviewers monitor user reports for the binding
    signal.
  - Tier 3 quarterly revisit owner is whoever runs the next
    `/sync-upstream` cycle after each Khronos Working Group public
    cadence event.
  - The fork's `docs/codecs/vvc.md` (forthcoming) will document the
    user-facing matrix: which codec on which hardware on which day.
