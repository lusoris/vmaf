# ADR-0125: MS-SSIM decimate SIMD fast paths (AVX2 + AVX-512)

- **Status**: Proposed (amended 2026-04-20 — separable-form chosen with
  empirical Netflix golden `places=4` gate; FLOP accounting corrected from
  ~9× to ~3×; removed non-existent snapshot-refresh premise)
- **Date**: 2026-04-20
- **Deciders**: Lusoris, Claude (Anthropic)
- **Tags**: simd, testing, agents

## Context

MS-SSIM runs a 5-scale pyramid. Each scale reduction in
[`libvmaf/src/feature/ms_ssim.c`](../../libvmaf/src/feature/ms_ssim.c)
calls [`_iqa_decimate`](../../libvmaf/src/feature/iqa/decimate.c) to
low-pass-filter the previous-scale image with a fixed 9×9 9/7
biorthogonal wavelet kernel (`g_lpf`) and subsample by factor 2. The
vendored decimate implementation walks every destination pixel and
invokes `_iqa_filter_pixel`, which evaluates the full 9×9 kernel in
scalar C (81 multiply-adds per destination pixel) and delegates
out-of-bounds access through a function pointer
([`KBND_SYMMETRIC`](../../libvmaf/src/feature/iqa/convolve.c)). On
1920×1080 inputs the decimate step alone accounts for roughly 40 % of
MS-SSIM wall time in profiling; the per-pixel function-pointer
indirection defeats the compiler's ability to keep kernel coefficients
in registers.

The SSIM primitives MS-SSIM reuses already have AVX2 and AVX-512
specialisations wired through `_iqa_ssim_set_dispatch` in
[`libvmaf/src/feature/iqa/ssim_tools.c`](../../libvmaf/src/feature/iqa/ssim_tools.c),
so x86 SIMD paths already exist elsewhere on this hot path; the decimate
step is the remaining scalar gap. The 9×9 LPF is also known to be
separable — `ms_ssim.c` defines the 1-D horizontal and vertical
coefficients (`g_lpf_h`, `g_lpf_v`) alongside the 2-D form, but
`_iqa_decimate` never uses them.

Two fork-wide rules shape the implementation:

- The `libvmaf/src/feature/iqa/` subtree is a verbatim BSD-2011 Tom
  Distler import. The fork treats it the same as upstream Netflix code
  for rebase hygiene — we do not modify it unless we have to.
- The Netflix CPU golden gate ([CLAUDE.md §8](../../CLAUDE.md)) does
  not exercise MS-SSIM (the three reference pairs assert VMAF and
  feature scores, not MS-SSIM), but any new SIMD path must still match
  scalar output exactly across cross-backend snapshot tests before
  landing.

## Decision

We add MS-SSIM-specialised decimate kernels under
`libvmaf/src/feature/x86/ms_ssim_decimate_avx2.{c,h}` and
`libvmaf/src/feature/x86/ms_ssim_decimate_avx512.{c,h}`, plus a new
scalar-separable reference
`libvmaf/src/feature/ms_ssim_decimate.{c,h}` that becomes the fallback
scalar path. Each SIMD kernel evaluates the separable 9-tap LPF
(using `g_lpf_h` / `g_lpf_v`) with the factor-2 subsampling fused into
the horizontal pass (only `w_out = w/2 + (w&1)` output columns are
produced per row). FLOP count drops from 81/dest-pixel (2-D) to
~13.5 MACs/dest-pixel counted at the source-image-pixel domain — a
**~3× FLOP reduction** before any SIMD lane parallelism
(horizontal: `w_out × h × 9`; vertical: `w_out × h_out × 9`; total
~`6.75 × w × h` MACs vs. `20.25 × w × h` for 2-D at factor=2). The
kernels assume the MS-SSIM use case:
`factor == 2`, `LPF_LEN == 9`, `normalized == 1`,
`bnd_opt == KBND_SYMMETRIC`, `float` input; any caller outside these
invariants falls back to the scalar `_iqa_decimate`. Dispatch lives in
`ms_ssim.c` (or a companion `ms_ssim_dispatch.c` if it grows), chosen
by the same `vmaf_get_cpu()` flags the SSIM dispatch uses. The vendored
`libvmaf/src/feature/iqa/decimate.c` is **not modified** — the
dispatching happens in the MS-SSIM caller, not in the iqa/ helper.

Bit-exactness is the correctness contract *between scalar-separable and
SIMD*. A new `libvmaf/test/test_ms_ssim_decimate.c` runs scalar-separable,
AVX2, and AVX-512 against the same synthetic + real-YUV inputs and
asserts byte-identical float output across all three (the SIMD reduction
order mirrors the scalar-separable reduction order via explicit sequential
`fmaf` / single-pass FMA reductions, following the fork pattern in
[`libvmaf/src/feature/x86/float_motion_avx2.c`](../../libvmaf/src/feature/x86/float_motion_avx2.c)).

The **scalar path itself** changes from the vendored 2-D `_iqa_decimate`
to the new separable path. This introduces a bounded numerical delta
vs. the pre-change 2-D output because (a) the 2-D kernel `g_lpf` is
precomputed at 6-decimal precision rather than the exact IEEE-754 outer
product of `g_lpf_h` × `g_lpf_v` (per-coefficient delta ≤ 5e-7) and
(b) IEEE-754 addition is non-associative, so separable and 2-D
summation orders produce different rounding even with identical
coefficients. No fork-local MS-SSIM score snapshot exists
(`testdata/scores_cpu_ms_ssim.json` is not in the tree), so the only
gate is the frozen Netflix golden-gate assertions in
`python/test/feature_extractor_test.py` at `places=4` tolerance
(~5e-5). The PR empirically verifies the end-to-end MS-SSIM score
shift stays within `places=4` by running the existing
`test_run_ms_ssim_fextractor` test before merge. If the cascade
through 5 pyramid scales + SSIM inner loop pushes any aggregate score
beyond `places=4`, the PR **falls back to vectorising the 2-D form
without switching to separable** (still ~8–16× lane parallelism from
SIMD, no FLOP reduction from separability, but bit-identical to the
vendored 2-D scalar).

NEON is deferred to a smaller follow-up PR on `arm64`; the dispatch
scaffold leaves a clear slot for `ms_ssim_decimate_neon` to plug into.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Specialise decimate for MS-SSIM's 9×9 separable LPF factor-2 case, x86 AVX2 + AVX-512 (chosen) | ~3× FLOP reduction from separable + stride-2 fusion; another ~8× (AVX2) or ~16× (AVX-512) lane parallelism on the inner region; leaves vendored iqa/ file untouched; matches the established per-feature `x86/*_avx2.c` layout; realistic day-scale delivery | Separable form drifts from the vendored 2-D scalar output (coefficient rounding + IEEE-754 non-associativity) — must empirically verify Netflix golden gate `places=4` tolerance absorbs the shift; no immediate benefit for non-MS-SSIM callers of `_iqa_decimate`; if `places=4` fails, fall back to 2-D-preserving SIMD | Decision — gated on empirical `places=4` check |
| Generalise `_iqa_decimate` itself with an AVX2/AVX-512 inner loop (edit the vendored file) | One code path for every decimate caller; smaller dispatch surface | Modifies BSD-2011 Tom Distler code — increases rebase noise if Netflix ever re-syncs upstream iqa/; the only other caller of `_iqa_decimate` in-tree today is also MS-SSIM, so the "generalisation" has zero extra consumers; mixing SIMD intrinsics into the vendored file pollutes a clean subtree | Rejected — no second caller exists, and modifying vendored code without cause is bad rebase hygiene (CLAUDE.md §10 / AGENTS) |
| Port the decimate step to the CUDA / SYCL backends as well in the same PR | Cross-backend parity in one shot | GPU backends are not bit-exact to CPU (per memory rule `feedback_golden_gate_cpu_only.md`); a bit-exactness PR that also touches GPU must either accept non-exactness (contradicting the contract) or duplicate the scalar-separable reference on device (huge scope creep) | Deferred to a follow-up; keep this PR CPU-only to keep the bit-exactness claim crisp |
| Keep scalar decimate; optimise `_iqa_filter_pixel` instead (inline it, drop the function pointer) | Smaller diff; no new files | Solves the indirection cost but not the 81-vs-9 FLOP gap; leaves the largest win on the floor | Rejected — the FLOP count is the dominant cost, not the indirection |
| Ship AVX2 + AVX-512 + NEON all in one PR | Single review for all ISAs | NEON needs a separate arm64 CI leg and the fork's arm64 NEON SIMD coverage is already ahead of x86 (VIF, ADM); bundling triples the review surface | Per user direction (popup 2026-04-20): "AVX2 + AVX-512 only, NEON follow-up" |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: MS-SSIM decimate wall time drops ~24× on the inner
  region (AVX2) / ~48× (AVX-512) vs. the current 2-D scalar path;
  Amdahl-bounded end-to-end MS-SSIM gain depends on the empirical
  decimate share of runtime (claim of ~40% is unverified, measured in
  the PR); the vendored `iqa/` subtree stays identical to its 2011
  upstream; the new kernels follow the established
  `libvmaf/src/feature/x86/*_avx2.c` pattern and are unit-tested for
  bit-exactness between scalar-separable / AVX2 / AVX-512; the
  dispatch scaffold makes the NEON follow-up a pure add rather than a
  refactor.
- **Negative**: MS-SSIM scalar output shifts vs. the pre-change 2-D
  scalar path — per-coefficient delta ≤ 5e-7 (the 2-D `g_lpf` is
  stored at 6-decimal precision, not the exact outer product of
  `g_lpf_h × g_lpf_v`) plus IEEE-754 non-associativity from the
  summation-order change; PR must empirically confirm
  `test_run_ms_ssim_fextractor` Netflix golden-gate assertions pass
  at `places=4` (~5e-5 aggregate tolerance); if any assertion fails,
  the PR falls back to vectorising the 2-D form (no separable switch,
  bit-identical to scalar). The SIMD kernel files add ~600 LOC of
  intrinsics that need Power-of-10 §5 assertion density coverage (≥1
  `VMAF_ASSERT_DEBUG` per function ≥20 lines).
- **Neutral / follow-ups**:
  - Research digest `docs/research/0008-ms-ssim-decimate-simd.md`
    (assigned ID 0008 — next after 0007 SSIMU2 port) captures the benchmark
    methodology, FLOP accounting, and prior art for separable wavelet
    decimation.
  - `docs/metrics/ms_ssim.md` (or a dedicated section in the nearest
    existing MS-SSIM doc) gets a "SIMD paths" subsection per ADR-0100
    per-surface bar for SIMD paths.
  - `.github/AGENTS.md` (or `libvmaf/src/feature/AGENTS.md` if we add
    a per-subtree one) gets a rebase-sensitive invariant note: the
    9×9 LPF coefficients in `ms_ssim.c` must match the coefficients
    hard-coded in `ms_ssim_decimate_{avx2,avx512}.c`; any upstream
    change to `g_lpf_h` / `g_lpf_v` requires re-deriving the SIMD
    coefficients.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` "lusoris fork" entry.
  - `docs/rebase-notes.md` entry: MS-SSIM SIMD paths are fork-only;
    re-test with `meson test -C build -t ms_ssim_decimate` after any
    upstream MS-SSIM touch.
  - NEON follow-up PR (arm64): `ms_ssim_decimate_neon.c`, same
    bit-exactness harness, smaller scope.
  - Reproducer command (for PR description): `meson test -C build
    test_ms_ssim_decimate` + `./build/libvmaf/tools/vmaf --feature
    ms_ssim -r python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv -d
    python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv -w 576 -h 324 -p
    yuv420p`.
