# ADR-0107: Tiny-AI Wave 1 scope expanded beyond ADR-0020 through ADR-0023

- **Status**: Supersedes [ADR-0036](0036-tinyai-wave1-scope-expansion.md)
- **Date**: 2026-04-18

## Context

ADR-0020 through ADR-0023 locked the four tiny-AI capabilities and their
user surfaces at an abstract level, but did not specify which checkpoints
ship in Wave 1 or which encoder-side hooks are in scope. The user
directed a deliberately broad Wave 1 covering scoring, encoder-side
hooks, and a debugging affordance, on the grounds that every candidate
model is small enough to share existing ONNX Runtime infrastructure and
that splitting the work across multiple waves would duplicate the same
op-allowlist and tensor-I/O changes.

This ADR re-states ADR-0036's decision in neutral English so the body
no longer carries colloquial verbatim quotes. The decision itself is
unchanged; only the prose register is.

## Decision

Wave 1 adds, beyond ADR-0020 through ADR-0023: **(a)** ship baseline
checkpoints for C1/C2/C3 into `model/tiny/` (today empty); **(b)**
LPIPS-SqueezeNet (~2.5M) as externally-validated FR baseline, exposed as
a new libvmaf feature extractor; **(c)** MobileSal saliency (~2.5M)
feeding both a saliency-weighted VMAF variant (scoring side) and a
per-CTU QP-offset ROI map (`tools/vmaf-roi`, encoder side); **(d)**
TransNet V2 (~1M) shot boundaries + per-shot CRF predictor CLI
(`tools/vmaf-perShot`) emitting an encoder-ingestible sidecar.
Encoder-side hooks: extend `vmaf_pre` from luma-8bit to 10-bit + chroma;
add new `vmaf_post` ffmpeg filter for post-reconstruction NR scoring;
FastDVDnet temporal pre-filter (~2.5M, 5-frame window) — deferred if
Wave 1 is too wide but still in-scope. Op-allowlist expansion: whitelist
`Loop` and `If` with a bounded-iteration guard (reject unbounded
`trip_count`, default cap 1024) — unlocks MUSIQ attention, RAFT optical
flow, small VLMs. `Scan` stays rejected. MCP surface: new
`describe_worst_frames` tool that runs a local VLM (SmolVLM ~256M,
Moondream2 1.8B Q4 fallback) on N worst-VMAF-delta frames and returns
plain-English artifact descriptions. Full roadmap: `docs/ai/roadmap.md`.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ship baseline C1/C2/C3 checkpoints only | Small scope; bisectable | Does not honor the user's broader Wave 1 directive; encoder-side stays untouched | Rejected |
| Expand Wave 1 (chosen) | Each added model <3M params, shares ORT infra, marginal cost low | Op-allowlist must expand | Rationale matches |

Rationale note: the narrow option was rejected because (a) the user
explicitly asked for the wider scope, (b) every model is tiny and shares
infrastructure, and (c) encoder-side work needs the same allowlist and
tensor-I/O extensions, so splitting across waves duplicates the
infrastructure changes. The Loop/If allowlist expansion is the single
largest risk, mitigated by the bounded-iteration guard.
`describe_worst_frames` is intentionally last-priority — a debugging
affordance, not a critical scoring path.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Wave 1 delivers LPIPS / saliency / shot-boundary / NR /
  encoder-side hooks together.
- **Negative**: larger PR footprint; op-allowlist must admit Loop/If
  safely.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: ADR-0039 (runtime op walk), ADR-0040
  (multi-input API), ADR-0041 (LPIPS extractor), ADR-0042 (docs rule)
  all descend from this expansion. ADR-0036 stays in the tree, marked
  `Superseded by ADR-0107`.
