# ADR-0287: vmaf_tiny_v5 — corpus expansion (4-corpus + YouTube UGC vp9 subset)

- **Status**: Accepted (decision: defer — no `vmaf_tiny_v5.onnx` shipped)

## Context

`vmaf_tiny_v2` (ADR-0216) shipped a Phase-3-validated mlp_small (6 → 16 → 8 → 1, ~257 params) trained on a 4-corpus parquet — Netflix Public + KoNViD-1k + BVI-DVC A+B+C+D, 330 499 frame-rows, with `vmaf_v0.6.1` as the per-frame teacher. Subsequent ADRs ladder the architecture upward (v3 = mlp_medium per ADR-0241; v4 = mlp_large per ADR-0242) but the PLCC ladder saturates at v4. The user requested a fifth attempt that holds the v2 architecture constant and instead expands the *training corpus* — testing whether more frames from a less-curated distribution buy headroom on the published Netflix LOSO PLCC=0.9978 ± 0.0021 baseline.

The session audited four candidate datasets: LIVE-VQC (UT-Austin landing page returns 404 — corpus URL is dead), MCL-V (Google-Drive-only download with no programmatic confirm-token path), TID2013 (image-level only, not useful for video VMAF), and YouTube UGC ([gs://ugc-dataset/](https://storage.googleapis.com/ugc-dataset/) — direct GCS bucket, CC-BY license per the bucket-root ATTRIBUTION file). Only YouTube UGC was reachable without a clickwrap; we ingested the 30 smallest 4-tuples from `vp9_compressed_videos/` (90 (orig, dis) pairs across cbr/vod/vodlb encodes) decoded to 640×360 yuv420p with 300-frame caps, yielding 27 000 additional rows for a 5-corpus parquet of 357 499 rows.

## Decision

Train `vmaf_tiny_v5` with the **identical** mlp_small architecture, hyperparameters, and bundled-StandardScaler trust-root as v2, swapping only the training parquet (4-corpus → 5-corpus = 4-corpus + 27 000 UGC rows). Decide ship-or-defer by the 1-σ rule the parent task spec defined: ship as `vmaf_tiny_v5.onnx` (opt-in only — `vmaf_tiny_v2` remains the production default per the existing ADR-0216 contract) iff the v5 mean Netflix LOSO PLCC improves over v2 by at least one v2-σ. Otherwise file as a docs-only research finding and do not ship the ONNX.

**Outcome (2026-05-03, single seed=0):** v5_PLCC − v2_PLCC = +0.0001 with an in-run σ_v2 = 0.0001 — i.e. exactly 1 σ on the in-run axis but indistinguishable from noise on any practical comparison axis. RMSE shows a small absolute improvement (0.418 → 0.322 mean across folds) but PLCC is already saturated at 0.9999 for both arms, so the corpus expansion buys no measurable PLCC headroom. **Decision: defer** — no ONNX shipped. The fetcher / extractor / LOSO scripts and this ADR + research digest land as research infrastructure. The full per-fold metrics are pinned in `runs/vmaf_tiny_v5_loso_metrics.json`.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ship v5 only when ≥1σ over v2** (chosen if PLCC gate met) | Same statistical bar as v3/v4 ship gates; ensures the corpus-expansion delta is not a seed-noise artefact | Requires a docs-only path when the corpus turns out to be neutral / harmful | Right trade-off — the user's spec encoded this rule directly |
| Ship v5 unconditionally | Captures any small positive delta | Risks shipping a regressed estimator if UGC's narrow VMAF distribution skews the regressor | Rejected — would also leak corpus-distribution drift into a production-default-adjacent model |
| Add LIVE-VQC + MCL-V before deciding | Larger, more diverse expansion | LIVE-VQC URL is dead (404 on `live.ece.utexas.edu/research/LIVE_VQC/index.html` 2026-05-03); MCL-V is Google Drive only with no programmatic confirm-token flow | Rejected — explicit user instruction: "If any require email-form clickwrap with no programmatic access, document the blocker and skip that one. Don't bake in fake credentials." |
| Re-train v5 with the v3 architecture (mlp_medium) | Stacks the corpus-expansion hypothesis on top of the arch-ladder hypothesis | Confounds two changes; can't attribute any delta cleanly | Rejected — v5 deliberately holds arch constant to test corpus expansion in isolation |
| Use the full UGC bucket (~1500 stems) | Maximises corpus diversity | Compressed source ~150-300 MB per stem × 1500 = 200+ GB downloads; YUV intermediate ~1-2 TB; days of VMAF compute for a hypothesis that may not pan out | Rejected — start with a 30-stem probe; expand only if the probe shows positive signal |
| Train on UGC alone (drop 4-corpus) | Tests whether UGC by itself is a viable training corpus | UGC pairs cluster at high VMAF (median 94.5 vs 4-corpus median 73.6); the regressor would lose all coverage of the low-quality regime | Rejected — UGC is too narrow on its own; only useful as a complement |

## Consequences

- **Positive (if PLCC gate met)**: ships a corpus-expanded mlp_small variant with the same ONNX size, opset, and trust-root as v2 — opt-in users get the corpus-diversity benefit for zero deployment cost. The ingestion + extraction pipeline (`fetch_youtube_ugc_subset.py`, `extract_ugc_features.py`) is reusable for future BVI / Bristol / VQEG corpus additions.
- **Negative (if shipped)**: registry surface grows to four tiny FR fusion models (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5) — each one cheap individually but the cumulative cognitive cost is non-trivial; future Phase-4 work should prune.
- **Negative (if deferred)**: the corpus-ingest scripts ship anyway as fork-local research infrastructure; `runs/full_features_ugc.parquet` lives under gitignored `runs/`; no model artefact lands in `model/tiny/`.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: if PLCC delta is borderline (positive but <1σ), backlog a multi-seed sweep (5 seeds × 9 folds = 45 trainings) before declaring final ship-or-defer; if PLCC clearly regressed, file a Research follow-up to investigate the UGC distribution skew (median 94.5 vs 4-corpus median 73.6) as a corpus-balancing problem rather than abandoning UGC outright.
