# vmaf_tiny_v3 — wider/deeper VMAF feature-fusion estimator

`vmaf_tiny_v3` is a tiny multi-layer perceptron that predicts a VMAF
score from the same six classic libvmaf features as
[`vmaf_tiny_v2`](vmaf_tiny_v2.md) (`adm2`, `vif_scale0..3`, `motion2`
— the canonical-6 set used by `vmaf_v0.6.1`). It carries roughly 3x
the hidden capacity of v2 (`mlp_medium` = 6 → 32 → 16 → 1, ~769
params vs v2's 257) to test whether extra capacity buys headroom
over v2's PLCC = 0.9978 ± 0.0021 baseline on Netflix LOSO.

> **Production default stays `vmaf_tiny_v2`.** v3 is shipped
> alongside v2 as a higher-PLCC option, not a replacement: the
> measured LOSO win is small (+0.0008 PLCC mean, lower variance),
> the parameter count triples, and the on-disk ONNX size grows from
> 2 446 to 4 496 bytes. Pick v3 when the extra PLCC is worth the
> extra capacity; pick v2 when you want the smallest possible
> bundle.

## What the output means

A single scalar per frame on the same 0–100 VMAF scale as the
classic SVM regressor and as v2. Identical interpretation table:

| Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **100** | Perceptually identical to the reference |
| **80–95** | High-quality encode |
| **60–80** | Visible compression artifacts |
| **< 60** | Heavy degradation |

The graph bakes the StandardScaler `(mean, std)` from the training
set as Constant nodes that run *before* the MLP — exactly the same
runtime contract as v2. There is no out-of-band scaler file to ship.

Effective topology:

```
features [N, 6]
   |
   Sub  <- mean   ([6] constant)
   |
   Div  <- std    ([6] constant)
   |
   Linear(6,32) → ReLU → Linear(32,16) → ReLU → Linear(16,1)
   |
   Squeeze(-1) -> vmaf [N]
```

## Training data

Identical to v2: `runs/full_features_4corpus.parquet` (Netflix Public
+ KoNViD-1k 5-fold + BVI-DVC A + B + C + D, 330 499 frame-rows × 22
FULL_FEATURES + `vmaf` teacher score from `vmaf_v0.6.1`). The
StandardScaler is fit on the 4-corpus union and baked into the
exported ONNX as Constant nodes.

## Validation

| Methodology | v2 (mlp_small, 257 params) | v3 (mlp_medium, 769 params) | Δ |
| --- | ---:| ---:| ---:|
| Netflix LOSO (9 folds, seed=0) mean PLCC | 0.9978 ± 0.0021 | **0.9986 ± 0.0015** | +0.0008 |
| Netflix LOSO mean SROCC | 0.9959 ± 0.0027 | **0.9977 ± 0.0017** | +0.0018 |
| Netflix LOSO mean RMSE | — | 1.256 ± 0.604 | — |
| 5000-row Netflix smoke PLCC | 0.9998 | **1.0000** | +0.0002 |
| Train-set RMSE (4-corpus) | 0.153 | **0.112** | -0.041 |
| Parameter count | 257 | 769 | ×3.0 |
| ONNX file size | 2 446 B | 4 496 B | +2 050 B (×1.84) |

LOSO methodology: for each of the 9 Netflix sources, the model is
trained from scratch on the union of the other 8 sources (with
StandardScaler fit on those 8) and evaluated on the held-out source.
Recipe held identical between v2 and v3 — only the architecture
function differs. Per-fold metrics are pinned in
`runs/vmaf_tiny_v3_loso_metrics.json`.

The PLCC delta is small in absolute terms but the variance shrinks
~30 % — v3 is a more *consistent* estimator across hold-out clips.
SROCC also improves by 0.0018 mean, suggesting the ranking signal is
slightly cleaner with the extra capacity.

The `min-PLCC = 0.97` ship gate runs in
`ai/scripts/validate_vmaf_tiny_v3.py` against
`runs/full_features_netflix.parquet`; refuses to exit-0 below the
gate.

## Usage — CLI

```bash
# Use vmaf_tiny_v3 instead of the default v2 / classic SVM.
vmaf -r ref.yuv -d dis.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -p 420 -b 8 \
     --tiny-model model/tiny/vmaf_tiny_v3.onnx \
     --tiny-device auto
```

`--tiny-device auto` walks `cuda → openvino → rocm → cpu`. As with
v2 the model is small enough (~4 KB) that dispatch overhead
dominates; CPU is usually the fastest path.

## Usage — Python (ONNX Runtime)

```python
import numpy as np
import onnxruntime as ort
import pandas as pd

sess = ort.InferenceSession("model/tiny/vmaf_tiny_v3.onnx",
                            providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])

df = pd.read_parquet("runs/full_features_netflix.parquet").head(100)
features = df[
    ["adm2", "vif_scale0", "vif_scale1",
     "vif_scale2", "vif_scale3", "motion2"]
].to_numpy(dtype=np.float32)

(vmaf,) = sess.run(None, {"features": features})
print(vmaf[:5])  # -> per-frame VMAF estimates
```

## Reproducer

    --out-json runs/vmaf_tiny_v3_loso_metrics.json
```

## Choosing between v2 and v3

* **Default to v2.** Smaller bundle (2 446 B vs 4 496 B), validated
  Phase-3 chain, +0.005–0.018 PLCC over the upstream SVM. v2 is the
  baseline for 99 % of users.
* **Use v3 when:** you need the lowest-variance VMAF estimator across
  diverse content (the LOSO std shrinks 30 %), or when the upstream
  pipeline is already paying ONNX-Runtime dispatch cost and the
  extra +0.0008 PLCC mean is worth the +2 KB.
* **Don't use v3 when:** disk / network footprint matters (e.g.
  embedded deploys, very-many-model bundles), or when the
  measurement target is upstream-comparable metrics — v2 is the
  cited baseline in the Phase-3 chain.

## Limitations

* The model fuses six **already-extracted** features — it is *not* a
  pixel-input quality model. To use it from raw YUV, the feature
  extraction stage runs first (the regular libvmaf path).
* Trained on SDR content. HDR coverage is out of scope until the
  upstream HDR feature extractors land.
* The 4-corpus parquet uses `vmaf_v0.6.1` as the teacher score; v3
  cannot exceed `vmaf_v0.6.1` in absolute correctness — it
  approximates the SVM with a slightly larger MLP.
* Bit-exactness across CPU/GPU execution providers is not guaranteed
  (ADR-0042 / ADR-0119 — places=4 tolerance applies to tiny-AI
  models too).
* Single-seed LOSO. v2's published 0.9978 was averaged over 5 seeds;
  v3's 0.9986 is the seed=0 number. A multi-seed v3 sweep is
  follow-up scope.
