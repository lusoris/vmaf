# `vmaf_tiny_v5` — deferred model card

> **Status**: Deferred. No `vmaf_tiny_v5.onnx` is shipped.

Per [ADR-0287](../adr/0287-vmaf-tiny-v5-corpus-expansion.md) the
`vmaf_tiny_v5` corpus-expansion experiment was **deferred** — the
training corpus expansion produced a smaller PLCC delta than the
v3 → v4 step, and the architecture ladder is treated as saturated
at v4 (per
[Research-0048](../research/0048-vmaf-tiny-v4-mlp-large-evaluation.md)).
There is no `vmaf_tiny_v5.onnx` shipped in `model/tiny/` and no
`v5` runtime path. This page exists so a reader looking for a v5
model card finds the deferral verdict instead of a missing document.

## Operator Impact

- Do not reference `vmaf_tiny_v5` in `model/tiny/registry.json`.
- Use [`vmaf_tiny_v4`](vmaf_tiny_v4.md) when you need the top shipped
  tiny-VMAF architecture.
- Treat any proposed v5 work as a new model-development PR with fresh
  training data, metrics, model card updates, and ADR coverage.
