# Tiny-AI — LOSO evaluation

Leave-one-source-out (LOSO) evaluation of the `mlp_small` regressor
on the Netflix corpus, using the harness in
[`ai/scripts/eval_loso_mlp_small.py`](../../ai/scripts/eval_loso_mlp_small.py).

LOSO is the honest evaluation regime for a 9-source corpus: each fold
trains on 8 sources and is scored on the held-out 9th. The single-split
val=Tennis baseline `vmaf_tiny_v1.onnx` (and its `mlp_medium` sibling)
remain shipped as the default tiny model, but their absolute-fit numbers
are biased by their training distribution. LOSO answers *"how well does
mlp_small actually generalize to a clip it has never seen?"* — which is
the user-facing question.

## What the harness does

1. Loads each of the 9 source clips' `(features, vmaf_v0.6.1)` arrays via
   `ai.train.dataset.NetflixFrameDataset(split="val", val_source=clip)`.
   Cached per-clip JSON under `~/.cache/vmaf-tiny-ai/<source>/` is
   reused; cold runs invoke the libvmaf CLI to populate the cache.
2. For each fold, loads
   `model/tiny/training_runs/loso_mlp_small/fold_<clip>/mlp_small_final.onnx`
   and scores it on its own held-out clip. Reports per-fold PLCC /
   SROCC / RMSE plus mean ± std across the 9 folds.
3. For each baseline (`vmaf_tiny_v1.onnx`,
   `vmaf_tiny_v1_medium.onnx`), scores per-clip and on the all-clips
   concatenation. The all-clips concat shows the score-axis offset
   that is hidden by per-clip evaluation.

The harness mirrors the per-fold accounting that MCP
[`compare_models`](../mcp/index.md) does for a single split, but
respects the LOSO split structure (each model has a different val
clip) without forcing 9 separate `compare_models` calls.

## Running it

```bash
# Default — uses .workingdir2/netflix as data-root, looks for fold ONNX
# under model/tiny/training_runs/loso_mlp_small, writes to runs/loso_eval/
python ai/scripts/eval_loso_mlp_small.py

# Explicit data root + custom output dir
python ai/scripts/eval_loso_mlp_small.py \
    --data-root /path/to/netflix-corpus \
    --out /tmp/loso-eval

# Use a different fold-output directory (e.g. mlp_medium LOSO sweep)
python ai/scripts/eval_loso_mlp_small.py \
    --loso-dir model/tiny/training_runs/loso_mlp_medium
```

Outputs:

* `runs/loso_eval/loso_mlp_small_eval.json` — machine-readable.
* `runs/loso_eval/loso_mlp_small_eval.md` — markdown summary.

Both directories (`runs/` and `model/tiny/training_runs/`) are
gitignored by design — training and eval outputs regenerate from
the corpus and the cached features, so they don't belong in the
tree.

## Producing the fold checkpoints

The 9 fold ONNX files are produced by looping the existing trainer
across each `--val-source`:

```bash
for src in BigBuckBunny BirdsInCage CrowdRun ElFuente1 ElFuente2 \
           FoxBird OldTownCross Seeking Tennis; do
  out=model/tiny/training_runs/loso_mlp_small/fold_${src}
  mkdir -p "$out"
  VMAF_TRAIN_OUT_DIR="$out" \
    bash ai/scripts/run_training.sh \
      --model-arch mlp_small \
      --epochs 30 \
      --val-source "$src"
done
```

On a populated `~/.cache/vmaf-tiny-ai/`, each fold takes ~6 min on
the documented `ryzen-4090` profile; total ~55 min. With a cold cache
add ~30 s of libvmaf feature extraction per source-clip on first
encounter.

## Reading the results

Per-fold PLCC of 0.93 – 0.99 indicates the regressor learns a
generalizable feature → score mapping; the mean across folds is the
honest "expected accuracy on a new clip" number. Per-fold RMSE is on
the VMAF-score axis (`y ∈ [0, 100]`); a per-fold RMSE of ~15 is
expected when the regressor has not seen the clip's score-distribution
shape.

The single-split baselines (`vmaf_tiny_v1.onnx`,
`vmaf_tiny_v1_medium.onnx`) score higher per-clip on the clips they
trained on, but their all-clips-concat PLCC drops because the score
axis is offset differently across clips and the baselines never
learned to align them. This is the reason LOSO is the more honest
metric.

## Known issues

The shipped baseline ONNX files
(`model/tiny/vmaf_tiny_v1*.onnx`) carry an embedded
`external_data.location` reference to their pre-rename filename
(`mlp_small_final.onnx.data` / `mlp_medium_final.onnx.data`). The
sibling `.data` file actually exists under the renamed name, so a
naive `onnxruntime.InferenceSession(path)` from outside `model/tiny/`
fails with `cannot get file size`. The harness works around this in
[`_load_session`](../../ai/scripts/eval_loso_mlp_small.py): it loads
the proto without external data, rewrites the location entries to
the actual sibling filename, and attaches the bytes manually. A
proper fix is a follow-up baseline re-export with the correct
embedded names.
