# CLAUDE.md — VMAF Fork (Lusoris)

## 🌟 GLOBAL PROJECT RULES (TOP PRIORITY)

These 2 rules apply to ALL agents, ALL tools, and ALL commits — without exception.
They override everything else in this file.

1. **NEVER modify Netflix golden-data assertions** (`python/test/` `assertAlmostEqual` values).
   They are the numerical-correctness ground truth. If scores drift, fix the code — not the assertions.
2. **EVERY user-discoverable surface gets human-readable documentation in the same PR** as the code.
   No docs = unmergeable PR. ADRs and code comments are not substitutes.

High-signal orientation for Claude Code sessions opened in this repo.
Non-Claude agents: see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (same content, tool-agnostic).

## 1. What this repo is

- Fork of [Netflix/vmaf](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) — perceptual video quality assessment.
- Additions on top of upstream:
  - SYCL / CUDA / HIP GPU backends (runtime-selected).
  - AVX2 / AVX-512 / NEON SIMD paths.
  - `--precision` CLI flag (default `%.6f` matching upstream golden gate; `--precision=max` opts in to `%.17g` IEEE-754 round-trip lossless — ADR-0119 supersedes ADR-0006).
  - Tiny-AI (ONNX Runtime) model surface — see `ai/`, `libvmaf/src/dnn/`.
  - MCP server — see `mcp-server/vmaf-mcp/`.
- License: BSD-3-Clause-Plus-Patent (upstream license preserved). See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- Default branch on this fork: `master`. Upstream is tracked as remote `upstream`.

## 2. How to build

Meson + Ninja (NOT CMake).

```bash
# CPU only (fastest build, no GPU deps required)
meson setup build -Denable_cuda=false -Denable_sycl=false
ninja -C build

# With CUDA (requires /opt/cuda + nvcc)
meson setup build -Denable_cuda=true -Denable_sycl=false
ninja -C build

# With SYCL (requires oneAPI / icpx)
meson setup build -Denable_cuda=false -Denable_sycl=true
ninja -C build

# Full (both backends)
meson setup build -Denable_cuda=true -Denable_sycl=true
ninja -C build
```

Shortcut: `/build-vmaf --backend=cpu|cuda|sycl|all` (skill).

**IDE note**: `${workspaceFolder}/build/` is the dir the
clangd / VS Code C/C++ extension reads from
([`.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`](.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json)).
Configure it with every backend you have a toolchain for —
otherwise `compile_commands.json` won't contain include paths
for `volk.h` / CUDA / SYCL headers and clangd lights up every
backend file with "undeclared identifier" errors. See
[docs/development/ide-setup.md](docs/development/ide-setup.md).

## 3. How to test

```bash
meson test -C build                     # all unit tests
meson test -C build --suite=fast        # fast subset (pre-push gate)
make test                               # full suite + ASan + UBSan
make test-netflix-golden                # the 3 Netflix CPU golden-data tests (see §8)
```

## 4. How to lint

```bash
make lint        # clang-tidy + cppcheck + iwyu + ruff + semgrep
make format      # clang-format + black + isort (write)
make format-check  # same, no writes (pre-commit / CI)
```

Skills: `/format-all`, `/lint-all`.

## 6. Coding standards

**Read [docs/principles.md](docs/principles.md) before writing C.** Summary:

- NASA/JPL Power of 10 (`.clang-tidy` enforces)
- JPL Institutional Coding Standard for C — applicable subset
- SEI CERT C & CERT C++ — mandatory
- MISRA C:2012 — informative only
- Style: K&R, 4-space, 100-char columns
- Banned functions: `gets`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf`, `strtok`, `atoi`, `atof`,
  `rand`, `system` — see `docs/principles.md §1.2 rule 30`.
- Every non-void return value is checked or explicitly `(void)`-discarded.

| Task                                | Skill invocation                              |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| New GPU backend (hip, vulkan, metal)| `/add-gpu-backend <name>`                     |
| New SIMD path                       | `/add-simd-path <isa> <feature>`              |
| New feature extractor               | `/add-feature-extractor <name>`               |

| Cross-backend numeric diff          | `/cross-backend-diff`                         |
| Port an upstream commit             | `/port-upstream-commit <sha>`                 |
| Sync with upstream master           | `/sync-upstream`                              |
| Regenerate test snapshots           | `/regen-snapshots` (justification required)   |

## 8. Netflix golden-data gate (do not modify)

The fork preserves Netflix's 3 canonical CPU reference test pairs as the source of truth
for VMAF numerical correctness:

1. Normal: `src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv` ↔ `src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv`
2. Checkerboard (1-px shift): `checkerboard_1920_1080_10_3_0_0.yuv` ↔ `..._1_0.yuv`
3. Checkerboard (10-px shift): `checkerboard_1920_1080_10_3_0_0.yuv` ↔ `..._10_0.yuv`

YUVs: `python/test/resource/yuv/`. Golden assertions: `python/test/quality_runner_test.py`,
`vmafexec_test.py`, `vmafexec_feature_extractor_test.py`, `feature_extractor_test.py`,
`result_test.py` (hardcoded `assertAlmostEqual` values). **Never modify these assertions.**
They run in CI as a required status check. Fork-added tests go in separate files.

## 9. Snapshot regeneration

Fork-added snapshot JSONs under `testdata/scores_cpu_*.json` and
`testdata/netflix_benchmark_results.json` are GPU/SIMD numerical snapshots, NOT Netflix
golden data. Regenerate intentionally via `/regen-snapshots`; include the justification
in the commit message.

## 10. Upstream sync

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf.git  # once
/sync-upstream                                               # creates PR
```

Use `/port-upstream-commit <sha>` for single-commit cherry-picks.

## 11. Release

Automated by `release-please` on pushes to `master`. Version scheme: `v3.x.y-lusoris.N`
(tracks Netflix upstream version + fork suffix). Signing is keyless via Sigstore.
Use `/prep-release` to dry-run locally before merging a release PR.

## 12. Hard rules for every session

1. **Never** modify Netflix golden assertions (§8).
2. **Never** `git push --force` to `master`. *(Also host-enforced: branch
   protection rejects force-push and deletion — see
   [ADR-0037](docs/adr/0037-master-branch-protection.md) /
   [release.md](docs/development/release.md#master-branch-protection).)*
3. **Never** commit to `master` directly — branch + PR, merge via squash or ff only.
   *(Also host-enforced: `required_linear_history: true` and 19 required status checks.)*
4. **Never** skip `make lint` before pushing.
5. **Never** commit benchmark output files (`testdata/netflix_benchmark_results.json`
   is usually noise from an ad-hoc run; stash it unless the run is formal).
6. **Every** commit message is Conventional Commits (`type(scope): subject`). Enforced
   by the `commit-msg` git hook.
7. **Every** new `.c` / `.h` / `.cpp` / `.cu` starts with the license header. Use
   `Copyright 2026 Lusoris and Claude (Anthropic)` for wholly-new files, Netflix
   header for upstream-touched files.
8. **Every** non-trivial architectural, policy, or scope decision gets its own
   ADR file `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-case.md` following
   [docs/adr/0000-template.md](docs/adr/0000-template.md) **before** the commit
   that implements it lands, plus an index row in
   [docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md). Non-trivial = another engineer
   could reasonably have chosen differently (directory moves, base-image
   policy, CI-gate semantics, test-selection rules, new dependencies,
   coding-standards changes). Bug fixes and implementation details do NOT
   need an ADR. Cite `req` (direct user quote) or `Q<round>.<q>` (popup
   answer) in the ADR's `## References` section; put the "why" in `## Context`
   and the runner-up options in `## Alternatives considered`. Planning
   dossiers under `.workingdir2/` may mirror ADRs for local continuity, but
   the tracked `docs/adr/` tree is authoritative. See
   [ADR-0028](docs/adr/0028-adr-maintenance-rule.md).
9. **Every** session re-reads [docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md) at
   start and writes missing `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` files + index rows for any
   decisions inherited from context before the next commit.
10. **Every** PR that adds or changes a user-discoverable surface ships
    **human-readable documentation** under `docs/` in the same PR as the code.
    User-discoverable means: CLI flags or binaries, public C API under
    `libvmaf/include/`, feature extractors, GPU backends / SIMD paths,
    `meson_options.txt` build flags, ffmpeg filter options, MCP tools, tiny-AI
    surfaces, and user-visible log / error / output-schema changes. Docs land
    in the existing topic tree — CLI in [`docs/usage/`](docs/usage/), C API in
    [`docs/api/`](docs/api/), extractors in [`docs/metrics/`](docs/metrics/),
    backends in [`docs/backends/`](docs/backends/), build / release in
    [`docs/development/`](docs/development/), tiny-AI in
    [`docs/ai/`](docs/ai/), MCP in [`docs/mcp/`](docs/mcp/), architecture /
    C4 in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/). The minimum bar is
    *per-surface* (see [ADR-0100](docs/adr/0100-project-wide-doc-substance-rule.md)
    §Per-surface minimum bars). Tiny-AI keeps the tighter 5-point bar in
    [ADR-0042](docs/adr/0042-tinyai-docs-required-per-pr.md) as the
    specialisation. Code comments and ADRs are *not substitutes* — they
    explain decisions to maintainers, not usage to humans. Internal
    refactors, bug fixes with no user-visible delta, and test-only changes
    are excluded.
11. **Every** fork-local PR ships the **six deep-dive deliverables** in
    the same PR (per [ADR-0108](docs/adr/0108-deep-dive-deliverables-rule.md)):
    (1) research digest under [`docs/research/`](docs/research/) (or
    "no digest needed: trivial"), (2) decision matrix in the
    accompanying ADR's `## Alternatives considered` (or "no
    alternatives: only-one-way fix"), (3) `AGENTS.md` invariant note in
    the relevant package (or "no rebase-sensitive invariants"), (4)
    reproducer / smoke-test command in the PR description, (5)
    `CHANGELOG.md` "lusoris fork" entry, (6) entry in
    [`docs/rebase-notes.md`](docs/rebase-notes.md) (or `no rebase
    impact: REASON`). *Fork-local* means anything not a verbatim port
    of upstream Netflix/vmaf code; pure upstream syncs and
    `port-upstream-commit` PRs are exempt. The PR template
    ([.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md))
    carries the checklist; reviewers verify it.
12. **Every** PR leaves every file it touches **lint-clean** to the
    fork's strictest profile (clang-tidy + cppcheck + the linters in
    `make lint`), regardless of whether the file is fork-local or
    upstream-mirror. "Touches" = any hunk in the PR's diff against its
    merge base. Refactor first (extract helpers, split oversized
    functions, rename reserved identifiers, `(void)`-cast discarded
    return values, ...). `// NOLINT` / `// NOLINTNEXTLINE` is reserved
    for cases where refactoring would break a **load-bearing
    invariant** — e.g., an ADR-0138 / ADR-0139 bit-exactness pattern
    that requires an inline per-lane reduction, or an upstream-parity
    identifier the rebase story depends on keeping verbatim. Every
    NOLINT cites inline the ADR / research digest / rebase invariant
    that forces it; a NOLINT without a justification comment is itself
    a lint violation. Historical debt from before this rule
    (pre-2026-04-21, ~18 `readability-function-size` NOLINTs +
    upstream `_iqa_*` suppressions) was discharged by PR #327
    (refactor pass) and PR #388 (citation closeout, ADR-0278);
    every NOLINT now in tree carries an inline citation. The
    rule does not backdate itself onto in-flight PRs that don't
    touch those files. See
    [ADR-0141](docs/adr/0141-touched-file-cleanup-rule.md) and
    [ADR-0278](docs/adr/0278-nolint-citation-closeout.md).
13. **Every** PR that closes a bug, opens a bug, or rules a Netflix
    upstream report not-affecting-the-fork updates
    [`docs/state.md`](docs/state.md) in the **same PR**. The update
    lands a row in the appropriate section (Open / Recently closed /
    Confirmed not-affected / Deferred) and cross-links the ADR, the
    PR + commit, and the Netflix issue (if any). State drift compounds
    across sessions — the rule trades a 30-second edit for hours of
    re-investigation cost when context resets. The PR template
    ([.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md))
    carries a checkbox; reviewers verify it. See
    [ADR-0165](docs/adr/0165-state-md-bug-tracking.md). Closes
    Issue #20.
14. **Every** PR that touches a libvmaf C-API surface, a CLI flag,
    a `meson_options.txt` entry, a public header, or any other
    interface that the in-tree `ffmpeg-patches/` patches consume
    must update **the relevant patch file in the same PR** — no
    exceptions. The fork ships its FFmpeg integration as a stack
    of patches against `n8.1` (see
    [`ffmpeg-patches/series.txt`](ffmpeg-patches/series.txt));
    when libvmaf adds a new entry point or renames an existing
    one, the patch that wires it through to FFmpeg's filter has
    to follow in the same PR. Otherwise the next person who
    rebases the patch stack inherits a silently-broken build.
    Applies to: new public C-API entry points used by any patch,
    renamed/removed entry points, new `--enable-libvmaf-*`
    configure flags, new `LIBVMAFContext` fields, new
    `vf_libvmaf.c` filter variants, any change to the symbols the
    `enabled libvmaf*` `check_pkg_config` lines probe. Does NOT
    apply to: pure libvmaf-internal refactors that don't change
    public headers, kernel implementations behind an existing
    public surface, doc-only changes, test-only changes. The PR
    template carries a checklist row; reviewers verify by running
    a series replay against a clean `n8.1` checkout
    (`git -C /path/to/ffmpeg-8 reset --hard n8.1 && for p in
    ffmpeg-patches/000*-*.patch; do git -C /path/to/ffmpeg-8 am
    --3way "$p" || break; done`) — per-patch `git apply --check`
    is **the wrong gate** because patches `0002…0006` build on
    each other and standalone-apply cleanly only against the
    cumulative state from earlier patches, not against pristine
    `n8.1`. See
    [ADR-0186](docs/adr/0186-vulkan-image-import-impl.md).

## 13. Interaction style — prefer the popup question tool

When the agent needs the user to decide between options, resolve ambiguity, or pick
priorities, **use `AskUserQuestion` (the in-chat popup) instead of writing a wall of
numbered questions in prose**. Prose questionnaires slow the user down — they have to
scroll, parse, and type a structured reply. The popup lets them click through in
seconds.

Rules of thumb:

- 2–4 focused questions per popup, each with 2–4 concrete option choices (+ auto "Other").
- Mark the recommended option `(Recommended)` as option 1 when one clearly wins.
- Use `preview` fields when comparing code snippets, configs, or mockups side-by-side.
- Reserve prose for explanations that set up the question, not for the question itself.
- Still fine to answer a direct user question in prose — this rule applies to *asking*,
  not to reporting.
