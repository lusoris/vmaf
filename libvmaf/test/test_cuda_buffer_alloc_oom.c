/*
 * Netflix#1420 reducer — attempt an oversized cuMemAlloc and assert the
 * fork's CHECK_CUDA wholesale rewrite returns -ENOMEM to the caller
 * instead of firing assert(0) and aborting the process.
 *
 * GPU-gated: if vmaf_cuda_state_init fails (no driver / no device) the
 * test skips with a pass so hosts without CUDA hardware still run the
 * suite green. The success criterion is "the process didn't abort and
 * the allocator returned -ENOMEM for an impossible size," not a
 * particular frame-level score.
