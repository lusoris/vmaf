/* Regression test for T-CUDA-FEATURE-EXTRACTOR-DOUBLE-WRITE.
 *
 * When the CLI auto-loads a default VMAF model and the user also passes
 * --feature <name>, both vmaf_use_features_from_model() (registering the
 * GPU twin, e.g. "adm_cuda") and the explicit --feature path (registering
 * the CPU extractor "adm") call feature_extractor_vector_append().  The old
 * dedup key was the vmaf_feature_name_from_options()-derived string, which
 * compares the extractor *name* ("adm" vs "adm_cuda") and therefore misses
 * the twin.  Both extractors ran and wrote to the same feature-collector
 * slot, producing 750+ "cannot be overwritten" warnings per scoring run.
 *
 * The fix deduplicates by provided-feature names: if any entry in
 * provided_features[] matches between the already-registered extractor and
 * the incoming one, the incoming context is destroyed and the registration
 * is silently skipped.  This test exercises that path using two synthetic
 * VmafFeatureExtractor descriptors that share one provided-feature name,
 * simulating a CPU/GPU twin pair without requiring CUDA to be compiled in.
