/**
 * @file libvmaf_vulkan.h
 * @brief Vulkan backend public API.
 *
 * Scaffolded by ADR-0175 / T5-1; full runtime landed via ADR-0178
 * (T5-1b). Kernel coverage matrix is complete for the default model
 * (VIF, ADM, motion, motion_v2, ssimulacra2, plus the GPU long-tail
 * batches per ADR-0193); see docs/backends/vulkan/overview.md.
 *
 * When libvmaf was built without `-Denable_vulkan=enabled`, every entry
 * point returns -ENOSYS unconditionally and the runtime treats vulkan as
 * disabled.
