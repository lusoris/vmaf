/**
 * @file libvmaf_hip.h
 * @brief HIP (AMD ROCm) backend public API — scaffolded by ADR-0209 / T7-10.
 *
 * **Status: scaffold only.** Every entry point currently returns -ENOSYS
 * pending a real implementation. The header lands so downstream consumers
 * can compile against the API surface; the kernels (ADM, VIF, motion)
 * arrive in follow-up PRs. Mirrors the Vulkan scaffold (ADR-0175) — see
 * ADR-0209 for the audit-first decision and rollout sequence.
 *
 * When libvmaf was built without `-Denable_hip=true`, every entry point
 * returns -ENOSYS unconditionally and the runtime treats HIP as
 * disabled.
 *
 * Header purity: the HIP runtime types (`hipDevice_t`, `hipStream_t`)
 * cross the ABI as `uintptr_t` to keep this header free of
 * `<hip/hip_runtime.h>`. Cast on the caller side.
