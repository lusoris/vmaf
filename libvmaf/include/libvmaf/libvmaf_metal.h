/**
 * @file libvmaf_metal.h
 * @brief Metal (Apple Silicon) backend public API — ADR-0361 / T8-1 through T8-1d.
 *
 * **Status: live.** The runtime (T8-1b, ADR-0420) and the first kernel set
 * (T8-1c/d, ADR-0421 — `integer_motion_v2.metal` + 7 additional
 * feature-extractor MSL shaders) are fully shipped. All 8 `.mm` dispatch
 * translation units and 8 `.metal` shaders are compiled, linked, and
 * registered. Entry points return 0 on Apple-Family-7+ (M1 and later) or
 * -ENODEV on Intel Macs and non-Apple hosts.
 *
 * Mirrors the HIP scaffold (ADR-0212) and the Vulkan scaffold (ADR-0175) —
 * see ADR-0361 for the audit-first decision and rollout sequence.
 *
 * When libvmaf was built without `-Denable_metal=enabled` (or built on
 * a non-macOS host where the Metal framework auto-probe failed), every
 * entry point returns -ENOSYS unconditionally and the runtime treats
 * Metal as disabled.
 *
 * Header purity: the Metal runtime types (`id<MTLDevice>`,
 * `id<MTLCommandQueue>`, `id<MTLBuffer>`) cross the ABI as
 * `uintptr_t` to keep this header free of `<Metal/Metal.h>` /
 * `<Metal/Metal.hpp>`. Cast on the caller side. Same convention the
 * HIP backend uses for `hipStream_t` / `hipEvent_t` (per ADR-0212)
 * and the Vulkan backend uses for `VkDevice` / `VkQueue` (per
 * ADR-0184).
 *
 * Apple-platform-only: device selection is gated on `MTLGPUFamily.Apple7`
 * (M1 and later). Intel Macs and non-Apple hosts surface as -ENODEV from
 * `vmaf_metal_state_init`. See ADR-0361 §"Apple Silicon-only" for reasoning.
 * CLI exposure: `--metal_device <N>` / `--no_metal` / `--backend metal`
 * (ADR-0422).

/* -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * IOSurface zero-copy import — ADR-0423 scaffold (T8-IOS).
 *
 * Mirrors the Vulkan import surface (ADR-0184 / ADR-0186): caller
 * holds an external GPU-resident frame, hands its opaque handle to
 * libvmaf, and the Metal feature kernels read it without a host
 * round-trip. The Metal flavour consumes `IOSurfaceRef` because
 * Apple's VideoToolbox hwdec delivers frames as `CVPixelBufferRef`
 * whose backing store is always an `IOSurface` — the canonical
 * shared-GPU-memory primitive on macOS / iOS. FFmpeg surfaces it
 * as `AVFrame->data[3] -> CVPixelBufferRef` from
 * `AV_HWDEVICE_TYPE_VIDEOTOOLBOX`; the caller pulls the IOSurface
 * with `CVPixelBufferGetIOSurface` before handing it here.
 *
 * Same-device contract: source IOSurfaces are bound to whichever
 * MTLDevice rendered them. libvmaf compute must run on the same
 * device, hence @ref vmaf_metal_state_init_external — symmetric to
 * @ref vmaf_vulkan_state_init_external. On a single-GPU Apple
 * Silicon Mac (the common case) there is only one Apple-Family-7+
 * device and the constraint is trivially satisfied; the external-
 * init entry point still exists so multi-GPU Mac Pro hosts get a
 * deterministic device match.
 *
 * Status: T8-IOS shipped under ADR-0423 — every entry point in this
 * block is a working IOSurface → VmafPicture import on
 * Apple-Family-7+ hosts via `IOSurfaceLock` + memcpy into a
 * shared-storage VmafPicture buffer. The texture-direct path
 * (`[MTLDevice newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:]` /
 * `CVMetalTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImage`) remains available as
 * a future optimisation when a Metal feature kernel needs per-sample
 * texture access patterns; v1 routes everything through the same
 * VmafPicture host-pointer pipeline the rest of the scoring
 * extractors consume.
