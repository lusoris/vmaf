/**
 * @file libvmaf_mcp.h
 * @brief Embedded MCP (Model Context Protocol) server public API.
 *
 * Scaffolded by ADR-0209 / T5-2 (audit-first). Runtime (cJSON +
 * mongoose vendoring, dedicated MCP pthread, SPSC ring buffer,
 * SSE / UDS / stdio transport bodies) lands via T5-2b in a
 * follow-up PR. The header surface here is stable for downstream
 * consumers: every entry point returns -ENOSYS while the runtime
 * is unwired, so a caller compiled against this header sees a
 * predictable error and can fall back to the external Python MCP
 * server under mcp-server/vmaf-mcp/.
 *
 * When libvmaf was built without `-Denable_mcp=true`, every entry
 * point still returns -ENOSYS unconditionally; the linker resolves
 * the symbols against the same stub TU at libvmaf/src/mcp/mcp.c.
 *
 * Threading model (per ADR-0128 + Research-0005):
 *   - The host calls `vmaf_mcp_init` after `vmaf_init` and before
 *     the first `vmaf_read_pictures`. Init pre-allocates the SPSC
 *     ring buffer; no further allocation crosses the measurement-
 *     thread boundary (NASA Power-of-10 rule 3).
 *   - One transport-start call (`_start_sse`, `_start_uds`,
 *     `_start_stdio`) per active transport — they may be combined.
 *     Each spawns a dedicated MCP pthread; the measurement thread
 *     drains at most N command envelopes per frame from the SPSC
 *     ring (bounded loop, NASA Power-of-10 rule 2).
 *   - `vmaf_mcp_stop` joins the MCP threads; `vmaf_mcp_close`
 *     releases the ring buffer + handle. Closing a NULL handle is
 *     a no-op.
 *
 * Auth surface (per ADR-0128 § "Operational guardrails"):
 *   - SSE binds to 127.0.0.1 only.
 *   - UDS uses filesystem mode 0700 on the socket file.
 *   - stdio is trusted by construction (host owns the fds).
 *
 * Error contract (negative errno):
 *   -ENOSYS — feature not built (or scaffold not yet wired).
 *   -ENODEV — transport-specific runtime unavailable
 *             (e.g. UDS on a non-POSIX host).
 *   -EINVAL — bad argument (NULL where required, malformed config).
 *   -ENOMEM — ring/buffer allocation failed at init.
 *   -EBUSY  — measurement already in flight (start refused).
