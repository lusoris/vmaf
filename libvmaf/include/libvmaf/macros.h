/**
 * VMAF_EXPORT — marks a public API symbol as visible in the shared library.
 *
 * libvmaf is compiled with -fvisibility=hidden so that only explicitly
 * annotated symbols appear in the dynamic symbol table of libvmaf.so.3.
 * Every function declared in libvmaf/include/libvmaf/ that is part of the
 * public C API must carry this attribute so that consumers can resolve the
 * symbol at link time.
 *
 * See ADR-0379 and Research-0092 for the full symbol-visibility audit and
 * rationale.
