/*
 * ssim_accumulate_lane.h — single-lane scalar-double reduction helper.
 *
 * Encodes the ADR-0139 per-lane SSIM accumulation formula in one place
 * so all SIMD variants (AVX2, AVX-512, NEON) share identical scalar
 * type promotion. The SIMD callers pre-compute the float-valued
 * intermediates (`srsc`, `l_den`, `c_den`, `sv_f`) in vector float
 * — those are bit-exact by construction — spill them to an aligned
 * float buffer, then call this helper per lane with `C1` / `C2`
 * passed as the C `double` literals required for bit-identity with
 * `ssim_accumulate_default_scalar` in ssim_tools.c.
 *
 * The helper is `static inline`: no TU-boundary overhead, no symbol
 * collision, and the compiler can fully unroll the per-lane loop in
 * the caller.
 *
 * Fork-local; see ADR-0139 + ADR-0141.
