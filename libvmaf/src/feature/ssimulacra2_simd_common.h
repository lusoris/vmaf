 * Shared plane descriptor used by the SSIMULACRA 2 SIMD
 * `picture_to_linear_rgb_*` entry points (ADR-0163). Decouples the
 * per-ISA TUs from the `VmafPicture` type — the dispatch wrapper in
 * ssimulacra2.c unpacks `VmafPicture` fields into this struct
 * before calling the SIMD kernel.
 *
 * `data` points at the first pixel of the plane; stride is in bytes.
 * `w` / `h` are the plane's native dimensions (may be subsampled
 * relative to the luma plane for chroma).
