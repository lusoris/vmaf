/*
 * MS-SSIM 2x decimate with the 9-tap 9/7 biorthogonal wavelet LPF.
 *
 * Replaces `_iqa_decimate(..., factor=2, &lpf_9x9, ...)` for the
 * MS-SSIM hot path. The 2-D 9x9 kernel in ms_ssim.c (`g_lpf`) is
 * replaced by an equivalent separable form using `g_lpf_h` /
 * `g_lpf_v` (IEEE-754 FMA accumulation, KBND_SYMMETRIC border).
 *
 * Numerical contract: the output MAY differ from `_iqa_decimate` by
 * up to a few ULPs per pixel because (a) `g_lpf` is precomputed at
 * 6-decimal precision rather than the exact outer product of
 * `g_lpf_h` x `g_lpf_v`, and (b) separable summation order differs
 * from the 2-D row-major order (IEEE-754 non-associativity). The
 * Netflix MS-SSIM golden-gate assertions absorb this shift at
 * `places=4` tolerance (~5e-5); see ADR-0125.
 *
 * This function is the scalar-separable reference. AVX2 / AVX-512
 * specialisations (when available) produce *bit-identical* output to
 * this scalar path; that is the correctness contract tested in
 * libvmaf/test/test_ms_ssim_decimate.c.
