/*
 * Deterministic replacements for libm `cbrtf` and the sRGB EOTF
 * (`powf((x + 0.055)/1.055, 2.4)`) used by the SSIMULACRA 2
 * extractor and its SIMD ports.
 *
 * **Why**: libm `cbrtf` / `powf` implementations differ by ~1 ulp
 * between glibc, musl, and macOS libSystem — this compounded to a
 * ~2e-4 per-frame drift in the pooled ssimulacra2 score across
 * test hosts. These replacements are **identical across hosts**
 * (no libc dependency) and give the fork byte-for-byte
 * reproducibility for the ssimulacra2 snapshot gate (ADR-0164).
 *
 * Accuracy vs libm: ~7e-7 on cbrtf (Newton–Raphson, 2 iterations);
 * ~2e-7 on sRGB EOTF (1024-entry LUT + linear interpolation;
 * values pre-computed and committed as hex-float bit patterns).
 *
 * The fork's SIMD ports (AVX2 / AVX-512 / NEON) use the same
 * helpers, so scalar-vs-SIMD bit-exactness (ADR-0161/0162/0163
 * invariant) holds by construction.
 *
 * Accuracy vs the libjxl `tools/ssimulacra2` reference: ~1e-6 per
 * frame. ADR-0130 never committed to libjxl bit-exactness in CI,
 * so this is within scope.

/* Deterministic cube root of a non-negative float.
 *
 * Bit-trick initial estimate via `(i / 3) + magic_constant` followed
 * by 2 Newton–Raphson iterations. Accuracy: < 1 ulp on inputs in
 * [1e-30, 1e+30]. Negative inputs return 0 (matches the scalar
 * reference's `if (l < 0) l = 0;` clamp in `linear_rgb_to_xyb`). */

/* Deterministic sRGB EOTF via precomputed LUT.

 * The LUT (1024 entries spanning x in [0, 1]) is committed as
 * hardcoded float bit patterns in `ssimulacra2_eotf_lut.h` — the
 * generator script `scripts/gen_ssimulacra2_eotf_lut.py` runs
 * offline. Runtime is pure float arithmetic (index, frac, 2
 * loads, 1 lerp) with no libc dependency.
 *
 * Piecewise structure matches the scalar reference: for x <=
 * 0.04045 return x / 12.92; for x > 1.0 return 1.0 (clamp already
 * happens upstream in the caller, but guard for safety). The LUT
 * already folds in the piecewise branch (for index i <= 41 ≈
 * 0.04045 * 1023 the LUT value is i/1023/12.92), so the runtime
 * path needs only the one load + lerp. */
