/*
 * AVX2 specialisation of ms_ssim_decimate_scalar.
 *
 * Bit-identical output contract: for every (src, w, h) pair this
 * function produces byte-for-byte the same `dst` as
 * `ms_ssim_decimate_scalar`. Lane-parallel evaluation uses per-lane
 * sequential `_mm256_fmadd_ps` with broadcast coefficients, so each
 * lane's accumulation order exactly mirrors the scalar reference's
 * `fmaf` chain. Border columns / rows where the 9-tap kernel would
 * cross the image edge are handled by an inline scalar fallback using
 * the same `fmaf` + KBND_SYMMETRIC mirror as the scalar reference.
 *
 * Tested in libvmaf/test/test_ms_ssim_decimate.c — the byte-identity
 * assertion runs on synthetic + real-YUV inputs.
 *
 * Invariants (rebase-sensitive; see libvmaf/src/feature/AGENTS.md):
 *   - Coefficients in this TU MUST equal `ms_ssim_lpf_{h,v}` in
 *     libvmaf/src/feature/ms_ssim_decimate.c.
 *   - Mirror semantics MUST equal `ms_ssim_decimate_mirror` in the
 *     scalar reference.
