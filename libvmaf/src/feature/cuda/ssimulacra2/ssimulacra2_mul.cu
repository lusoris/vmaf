 *  CUDA kernel for the ssimulacra2 elementwise plane multiply.
 *  Mirrors `multiply_3plane` in libvmaf/src/feature/ssimulacra2.c
 *  — operates on a contiguous 3-plane buffer; out[i] = a[i] * b[i].
 *
 *  Per-scale dispatch: grid = ceil(w / 16) * ceil(h / 8); each thread
 *  writes one (x, y, c) sample. The 3 channels are stored at offsets
 *  c * plane_stride (= full_w * full_h, kept constant across pyramid
 *  scales for layout consistency with the host buffers).
 *
 *  No reduction here — pure scalar multiply, FMA-free by definition.
 *  The ssim/edge_diff per-pixel double-precision combine is host-side
 *  (matches the Vulkan kernel; see ssimulacra2_cuda.c::extract).
