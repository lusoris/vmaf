# AGENTS.md — vendored cJSON

## Vendor policy

This directory contains a vendored copy of [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)
pinned at **v1.7.18** (the current upstream stable release as of 2026-05-16).

- **Do not** apply NOLINTs to banned-function violations in this file. Instead,
  either fix the call site or sync to a clean upstream version.
- **Banned functions** (`sprintf`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strtok`, `atoi`, `atof`,
  `gets`, `rand`, `system`) are **not** exempt from the fork's lint rules, even
  in vendored code. See [docs/principles.md](../../../../docs/principles.md) §1.2 rule 30
  and [ADR-0452](../../../../docs/adr/0452-cjson-banned-function-remediation.md).
- **To update**: replace `cJSON.c` and `cJSON.h` with the upstream release, then
  re-verify that no banned functions remain. Run
  `grep -n '\bsprintf\b\|\bstrcpy\b\|\bstrcat\b' libvmaf/src/mcp/3rdparty/cJSON/cJSON.c`
  after any sync.
- The `LICENSE` file must be kept in sync with the upstream release.

## Rebase note

cJSON is an internal dependency of the MCP server (`libvmaf/src/mcp/`). It does
not appear in the public C API (`libvmaf/include/`) and is not consumed by
`ffmpeg-patches/`. Upstream Netflix/vmaf does not vendor cJSON, so there is no
rebase conflict risk from the Netflix side. Conflicts can only arise if this fork
adds a second copy of cJSON elsewhere.
