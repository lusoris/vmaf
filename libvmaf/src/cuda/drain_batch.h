 *  CUDA fence-batching helpers (T-GPU-OPT-1, ADR-0242).
 *
 *  Background
 *  ----------
 *  Each kernel-template-based CUDA feature extractor records a private
 *  ``finished`` event on its drain stream after its DtoH readback
 *  (see ``kernel_template.h`` :: ``VmafCudaKernelLifecycle``). The
 *  legacy collect path called ``cuStreamSynchronize(lc->str)`` once
 *  per extractor — N driver round-trips per frame, where N is the
 *  number of co-scheduled CUDA extractors (3 for the
 *  ``vmaf_v0.6.1`` model, up to 12 with extra features enabled).
 *
 *  Optimization
 *  ------------
 *  This module batches those N round-trips into a single
 *  ``cuStreamSynchronize`` on a shared drain stream:
 *
 *      drain_open()                 — engine enters submit-all mode
 *      drain_register(lc) × N       — extractors join during submit()
 *      drain_flush(cu_state)        — engine waits all N events at once
 *                                     and marks each lifecycle drained
 *      drain_close()                — engine leaves the batch
 *
 *  After ``drain_flush``, ``vmaf_cuda_kernel_collect_wait`` skips its
 *  per-stream sync because the lifecycle's ``drained`` flag is set,
 *  so each ``collect()`` becomes a host-side buffer-read only.
 *
 *  Bit-exactness invariant
 *  -----------------------
 *  The optimization is **scheduling-only**. The same kernels execute
 *  on the same streams in the same order; only the host-side wait
 *  point changes. CUDA cross-stream ordering is preserved by
 *  ``cuStreamWaitEvent`` on each registered ``finished`` event before
 *  the single sync. Bit-exact tolerance: places=4 (fork-wide gate).
 *
 *  Concurrency
 *  -----------
 *  All state is **thread-local** — each orchestrator thread keeps
 *  its own batch. The library's frame loop is single-threaded for
 *  the GPU dispatch path (the ``thread_pool`` parallelisation is for
 *  CPU extractors only — see ``read_pictures_should_skip``), so the
 *  TLS scope matches the actual call graph.
 *
 *  Failure mode
 *  ------------
 *  If ``drain_register`` overflows the static cap, the lifecycle is
 *  silently skipped and its ``drained`` flag stays cleared, so
 *  ``vmaf_cuda_kernel_collect_wait`` falls back to the per-stream
 *  sync. This is degraded but correct.
