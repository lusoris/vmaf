 *  HIP per-feature kernel scaffolding template — first-consumer
 *  mirror of `libvmaf/src/cuda/kernel_template.h` (ADR-0221).
 *
 *  T7-10 first-consumer PR (ADR-0241). The CUDA template captured
 *  the lifecycle every fork-added CUDA feature kernel converged on
 *  (private non-blocking stream + 2-event submit/finished pair +
 *  device accumulator + pinned host readback slot). HIP exposes the
 *  same async-stream + event surface as CUDA (`hipStream_t`,
 *  `hipEvent_t`, `hipMemcpyAsync` ...), so the template's shape ports
 *  one-to-one.
 *
 *  Scaffold posture: this header lands ahead of the HIP runtime
 *  (T7-10b). The struct definitions are stable C surface so consumer
 *  TUs can compile without `<hip/hip_runtime.h>`. The lifecycle
 *  helpers `vmaf_hip_kernel_lifecycle_init/_close`,
 *  `vmaf_hip_kernel_readback_alloc/_free`,
 *  `vmaf_hip_kernel_submit_pre_launch`,
 *  `vmaf_hip_kernel_collect_wait` are declared here and stubbed in
 *  `libvmaf/src/hip/kernel_template.c`. Every helper currently returns
 *  -ENOSYS until the runtime PR replaces the bodies with real HIP
 *  calls. The consumer (`integer_psnr_hip.c`) calls them through the
 *  same call-graph the CUDA reference uses, so the runtime PR can
 *  swap bodies without touching consumers.
 *
 *  Why a paired .c instead of inline `static inline` helpers like the
 *  CUDA template? Two reasons:
 *
 *    1. The CUDA helpers are inline because they unwrap straight onto
 *       `cu_state->f->cuStreamCreateWithPriority` etc. — every call
 *       resolves at compile time against the `CudaFunctions` driver
 *       table. HIP has no equivalent driver-loader scaffolded yet
 *       (the runtime PR is still pending), so the helper bodies must
 *       carry a -ENOSYS check that callers cannot inline away. A real
 *       (non-inline) function gives one place to flip from -ENOSYS to
 *       a real `hipStreamCreate` call when the runtime arrives.
 *    2. Splitting declaration from definition lets the runtime PR
 *       replace the bodies without recompiling every consumer TU —
 *       the kernel-template ABI stays stable.
 *
 *  When the runtime PR (T7-10b) lands, the bodies in
 *  `kernel_template.c` flip from -ENOSYS to real HIP calls and the
 *  documentation here drops the "scaffold" caveats. The struct shape
 *  and helper signatures stay verbatim — that's the load-bearing
 *  contract this PR pins.
 *
 *  Reference implementation (CUDA): see
 *  `libvmaf/src/cuda/kernel_template.h` and
 *  `libvmaf/src/feature/cuda/integer_psnr_cuda.c`.
 *  First HIP consumer:
 *  `libvmaf/src/feature/hip/integer_psnr_hip.c`.

 *  Migration guide: `docs/backends/kernel-scaffolding.md`.
