- **CUDA `integer_motion` flush is idempotent on the last frame.**
  T-GPU-OPT-1 (PR #312) introduced a flow in `flush_context_cuda`
  where pending double-buffered work is collected via
  `vmaf_feature_extractor_context_collect` *before* the per-extractor
  `flush_fex_cuda` runs. For `integer_motion_cuda`, that pending
  collect already wrote `motion2_score[s->index]` /
  `motion3_score[s->index]` (last frame); `flush_fex_cuda` then re-
  appended at the same index, triggering
  `feature "VMAF_integer_feature_motion2_score" cannot be overwritten
  at index N` and propagating `-EINVAL` up to
  `flush_context_cuda` — surfacing as `context could not be
  synchronized / problem flushing context` even though CUDA itself
  was healthy. Fix: probe `vmaf_feature_collector_get_score` before
  appending; skip the write if the slot is already populated.
  Validated locally on the 576×324 Netflix golden pair (CUDA score
  94.324112 vs CPU 94.323011, |Δ|=1.1e-3 — within ADR-0214
  cross-backend drift envelope).
