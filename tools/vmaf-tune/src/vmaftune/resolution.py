"""Resolution-aware VMAF model selection + per-resolution CRF offsets.

Background — VMAF ships two production-grade pooled-mean models in this
fork's ``model/`` tree:

- ``vmaf_v0.6.1.json`` — trained on a 1080p-display viewing setup; the
  default for HD content.
- ``vmaf_4k_v0.6.1.json`` — re-fit for a 4K display setup; recommended
  by Netflix for any encode whose target display is UHD.

The wrong model on the wrong resolution biases scores by several VMAF
points (4K content scored against the 1080p model under-counts spatial
detail; 1080p content scored against the 4K model over-counts coding
artefacts). Phase A of ``vmaf-tune`` ran every cell against one fixed
model — fine for a single-resolution sweep, lossy for a mixed-ladder
corpus.

This module defines the decision rule:

- height ≥ 2160 → 4K model
- otherwise → 1080p model (the fork has no 720p / SD model; 1080p is
  the canonical fallback and matches Netflix's published guidance).

It also exposes a per-resolution CRF offset hook: when bisecting an ABR
ladder for a flat target VMAF, the rate-distortion shift across
resolution rungs is large enough that a single CRF anchor under-shoots
the bottom rungs and over-shoots the top. The offset returned here is a
small integer the search layer can apply when seeding bisect bounds.

The offsets are defaults, tuned from public AV1 / x264 ABR ladder
research; see ``docs/research/0064-vmaf-tune-resolution-aware.md`` for
provenance. They are intentionally conservative — Phase B / C / D will
learn per-codec offsets from real corpora and override these.
