"""Predicate-driven CRF recommendation over a corpus.

The Phase A corpus already produces ``(preset, crf, bitrate_kbps,
vmaf_score)`` tuples. ``recommend`` re-uses those rows and applies a
user-supplied predicate:

- ``--target-vmaf T`` — return the row with the *smallest* CRF whose
  ``vmaf_score >= T``. Falls back to the row with the highest VMAF if
  no row clears the bar.
- ``--target-bitrate B`` — return the row whose ``bitrate_kbps`` is
  closest to ``B`` (absolute distance, ties broken by smaller CRF).

Mutually exclusive — exactly one target must be specified.

The orchestration is deliberately thin: the corpus loader either
consumes a pre-existing JSONL (``--from-corpus``) or builds one on the
fly with the same machinery as the ``corpus`` subcommand. The
predicate evaluation is independent of how the rows were obtained.

Implements Buckets #4 (target-bitrate) and #5 (target-vmaf) from the
capability audit (Research-0061).

Uncertainty-aware extension (ADR-0279, this PR)
------------------------------------------------

The conformal-VQA prediction surface in :mod:`vmaftune.conformal`
(PR #488) wraps the predictor's point VMAF estimate in a
``(point, low, high)`` interval whose width carries the predictor's
local confidence. When the caller supplies that interval per row
(via :class:`UncertaintyAwareRequest`) the search loop becomes:

* **Tight interval** (``width <= tight_max``) — the predictor is
  confident; ``pick_target_vmaf_with_uncertainty`` short-circuits
  the search as soon as the *first* row whose ``low`` clears the
  target is observed. The "interval-aware search cost" is
  :math:`O(k)` instead of the :math:`O(n)` full scan, where ``k``
  is the index of the first sufficiently-confident row.
* **Wide interval** (``width >= wide_min``) — the predictor is
  uncertain; the search refuses to short-circuit on any single row
  and instead falls back to the full point-estimate scan with the
  returned :class:`RecommendResult` flagged ``predicate=...
  (UNCERTAIN)`` so downstream tooling knows the result was picked
  under high uncertainty.
* **Middle band** — defer to the native non-uncertainty recipe
  (the existing :func:`pick_target_vmaf` semantics, unchanged).

Math: a row "definitely clears the target" iff its conformal lower
bound ``low >= target`` (the entire 1-alpha interval lies above
the bar). A row "definitely misses" iff ``high < target`` (the
whole interval lies below). The decision rule above promotes the
first definitely-clearing row only when the interval is tight
enough that the conservative ``low`` is a faithful proxy for the
truth (Lei et al. 2018 Theorem 2.2 marginal-coverage bound).

Per :mod:`vmaftune.uncertainty` documentation, the uncertainty
recipe **only** affects search cost / which row gets picked from
an *equivalence class of qualifying rows*; it does **not** widen
the production-flip gate that lives in
:mod:`vmaftune.predictor_validate`.
