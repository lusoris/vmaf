"""Validation harness — verify the VMAF predictor on a few real shots.

The colleague's ask: "verify a few of those shots against real vmaf".
This module is the verify half of the predict-then-verify loop:

1.  :func:`select_validation_shots` — picks K shots from the full set,
    stratified by the predictor's complexity proxy (probe bitrate
    quartile) so the validation samples the predictor's full operating
    range, not just the easy shots.
2.  :func:`validate_predictor` — for each selected shot, runs the real
    encode at the predictor-picked CRF, scores with libvmaf via
    :mod:`vmaftune.score`, and computes residuals.
3.  Emits a :class:`Verdict`:

    * ``GOSPEL`` — every residual within
      ``residual_threshold_vmaf`` (default 1.5). Trust the predictor on
      the remaining shots.
    * ``RECALIBRATE`` — residuals biased but tight. Apply a per-movie
      one-parameter linear shift correction, redo the picks. Cheap;
      doesn't require retraining the ONNX model.
    * ``FALL_BACK`` — residuals too wide. Degrade to the full
      encode-and-score loop on remaining shots and log to follow-up.

The 3-4 % overhead budget the colleague cares about: K=8 on a
1 800-shot movie is 0.4 % for validation. The probe encodes themselves
(in :mod:`vmaftune.predictor_features`) add ~2-3 % on top. Totals fit
the budget.
