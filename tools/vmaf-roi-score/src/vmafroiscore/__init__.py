"""``vmaf-roi-score`` — region-of-interest VMAF *scoring* (Option C).

Distinct surface from `libvmaf/tools/vmaf_roi.c` (ADR-0247), which is
the *encoder-steering* sidecar that emits per-CTU QP offsets. This
package is the *scoring* counterpart: it produces a saliency-weighted
combination of two VMAF runs.

Math::

    roi_vmaf = (1 - w) * vmaf_full + w * vmaf_masked

where ``vmaf_full`` is the standard full-frame VMAF and ``vmaf_masked``
is the VMAF of a saliency-masked variant of the distorted YUV (low-
saliency pixels substituted with reference pixels so they score as a
perfect match).

Option C is intentionally tool-level: it drives the existing ``vmaf``
binary twice and combines pooled scalars. It does
**not** modify libvmaf's per-pixel feature pooling, and it therefore
cannot deliver true per-pixel saliency-weighted VMAF — see
ADR-0296 for the deferred Option A roadmap.
