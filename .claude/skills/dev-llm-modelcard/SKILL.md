description: Draft a Markdown model-card for a shipped ONNX tiny-AI model by collecting hard facts (graph, sidecar, op allowlist, optional live PLCC/SROCC) and handing them to the local LLM.

# /dev-llm-modelcard

## Invocation

```
/dev-llm-modelcard <onnx-path> [--features <parquet>] [--split test|val|train|all] [--model <ollama-model>]
```

## Steps

1. Verify `vmaf-dev-llm check` is green. If not, abort and point the user
   at `ollama serve`.
2. Resolve the ONNX path; reject anything outside the repo unless the
   user explicitly confirms (model cards for random host files are
   almost never what the user wants).
3. Run `vmaf-dev-llm modelcard --onnx <path> [--features <parquet>]
   [--split …] [--facts-only]` twice:
   - First with `--facts-only` to show the user the fact block that will
     be handed to the LLM — this is the trust boundary; the LLM cannot
     invent anything past this point.
   - If the user approves, run it again without `--facts-only` to get
     the rendered card.
4. Show the draft. Offer three actions:
   - **save** — write it to `model/<name>.md` (beside the `.onnx` /
     `.json`), using the `Write` tool.
   - **copy** — print verbatim for the user to paste.
   - **regenerate** — re-run step 3, optionally with `--model` overridden.
5. Never save automatically; model cards are published artifacts.

## Guardrails

- The facts block is the source of truth. If a field is missing, the
  rendered card must say "not recorded", not invent a value. Flag any
  output that contradicts the facts block.
- Always pass `--repo-root` pointing at the repo (defaults to CWD, so
  invoke the skill from the repo root).
- If `--features` is a dataset the user did not train on, surface that
  in the card under "Measured quality" — PLCC on an out-of-distribution
  split is a useful data point but should not be conflated with
  training performance.
- Do NOT run this skill on models under `subprojects/` — those are
  vendored upstream and ship their own documentation.

## Typical uses

- Publishing a model: before merging a new tiny-AI model into
  `model/tiny/`, generate its card and commit the `.md` alongside.
- Auditing a shipped model: a reader who sees a .onnx in `model/` can
  run this skill to get a structured summary of provenance + contract.
