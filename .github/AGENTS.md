# Agent notes — `.github/` (workflows + templates)

This directory holds GitHub-facing config: Actions workflows, issue /
PR templates, the CODEOWNERS file. Everything here is fork-local —
Netflix/vmaf upstream has its own `.github/` that rarely overlaps
path-wise, so conflicts on merge tend to be rare but high-impact
when they happen (a silently-broken workflow is less visible than a
broken `.c` file).

## Invariants a reviewer or sync must preserve

### Rule-enforcement split (ADR-0124)

[`rule-enforcement.yml`](workflows/rule-enforcement.yml) has three
jobs. Only **one** is allowed to be required-status-check-blocking:

- `deep-dive-checklist` — **blocking**. Predicate is mechanically
  decidable (ticked checkboxes + referenced files in diff).
- `doc-substance-check` — **advisory** (`continue-on-error: true`).
  Predicate needs "is this a pure refactor?" judgement.
- `adr-backfill-check` — **advisory** (`continue-on-error: true`).
  Predicate needs "is this decision non-trivial?" judgement.

The advisory/blocking split is load-bearing — see
[ADR-0124](../docs/adr/0124-automated-rule-enforcement.md) §Consequences
and the VIF-fix false-positive in
[Research-0002](../docs/research/0002-automated-rule-enforcement.md)
§"Dead ends". Moving either advisory job into `required_status_checks`
(or flipping its `continue-on-error` flag) is a policy change and
needs a superseding ADR.

### Opt-out syntax parser

The `deep-dive-checklist` job parses PR bodies for ADR-0108's
opt-out lines:

```text
no digest needed: <reason>
no alternatives: <reason>
no rebase-sensitive invariants
no reproducer needed: <reason>
no changelog needed: <reason>
no rebase impact: <reason>
```

Regex is intentionally loose on wording. If
[`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) ever renames
the six deliverables, the parser's `key` mapping in
`rule-enforcement.yml` (step "Parse six-deliverable checklist")
must move in lockstep. Search for the `case "${item}" in` block.

### Upstream-port exemption

`deep-dive-checklist` skips when the PR title starts with `port:` /
`port(scope):` or the branch name starts with `port/`. Those are
the only two knobs; a port PR that uses neither form WILL be
blocked. If the sync skill
([`.claude/skills/port-upstream-commit/`](../.claude/skills/port-upstream-commit/))
ever changes its branch-naming or title convention, update the
workflow's `Skip upstream-port PRs` step.

### Advisory surface-path lists

Both advisory jobs grep the diff for specific path prefixes
(`libvmaf/include/`, `meson_options.*`, `mcp-server/`, etc.).
These mirror
[ADR-0100](../docs/adr/0100-project-wide-doc-substance-rule.md) §Per-surface
and the ADR-policy-surface list from
[ADR-0106](../docs/adr/0106-adr-maintenance-rule.md). When either
ADR adds a new user-discoverable or policy-surface path, update the
grep patterns in `rule-enforcement.yml` in the same PR — otherwise
the advisory goes silent on the new surface.

### SHA-pin invariant for `uses:` directives

Every `uses:` directive in `.github/workflows/*.yml` MUST reference a
40-char commit SHA, with the original semver tag preserved as a
trailing `# vN.M.K` comment. Floating-tag references (`@v4`,
`@release/v1`) trip the OSSF Scorecard `Pinned-Dependencies` check
and are rejected by the sync gate below.

**Single permitted exception**:
`slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml`
keeps its `vX.Y.Z` tag form because GitHub Actions consumers cannot
SHA-pin reusable-workflow refs in every code path; the carve-out is
documented inline in
[`workflows/supply-chain.yml`](workflows/supply-chain.yml) and
mirrored in
[`docs/rebase-notes.md` entry 0231](../docs/rebase-notes.md).

**Sync gate** (run before merging any `/sync-upstream` that touches
`.github/workflows/`):

```bash
grep -hnE '^\s*(- )?uses:\s+[^@]+@[^ #]+\s*$' .github/workflows/*.yml \
  | grep -vE '@[a-f0-9]{40}' \
  | grep -v 'slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/'
# Empty output = clean. Anything that prints needs to be SHA-pinned
# before the sync PR can merge.
```

**Resolution recipe** when adding a new action or bumping an existing
pin:

```bash
# Lightweight tag (most actions):
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/ref/tags/<vN.M.K> --jq '.object.sha'
# Annotated tag (e.g. github/codeql-action, ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd,
# pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish) — first call returns
# `object.type == "tag"`; dereference it:
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/tags/<sha-from-prev> --jq '.object.sha'
```

See [ADR-0263](../docs/adr/0263-ossf-scorecard-policy.md) for the
project-level Scorecard policy (introduced by PR #337) and entry 0231
of [`docs/rebase-notes.md`](../docs/rebase-notes.md) for the standing
re-test command.

### Dependency-update bot: Renovate, not Dependabot (ADR-0363)

The fork uses **Mend Renovate** self-hosted via
[`workflows/renovate.yml`](workflows/renovate.yml). `.github/dependabot.yml`
has been removed and its content archived as `.github/dependabot.yml.disabled`.

On upstream sync:

- If Netflix adds a `dependabot.yml`, do **not** restore it — merge the content
  into `dependabot.yml.disabled` for reference only. The fork's dependency-update
  bot is Renovate; running both simultaneously causes duplicate PRs.
- `renovate.yml` and `renovate.json` are fork-local; Netflix upstream will never
  ship them. They are safe from upstream conflicts.
- `RENOVATE_TOKEN` is a repository secret; it is not committed anywhere. The
  operator playbook is at
  [`docs/development/dependency-bot.md`](../docs/development/dependency-bot.md).

## Upstream-merge guidance

Netflix/vmaf ships its own workflows under `.github/workflows/`
(CI, release, etc.). The fork's workflows live alongside them; file
collisions are rare because the fork-added workflow names
(`rule-enforcement.yml`, `nightly-bisect.yml`, `supply-chain.yml`,
`renovate.yml`, etc.) don't clash with upstream's names. On sync:

1. Preserve every fork-added workflow verbatim unless the ADR that
   introduced it is superseded.
2. For workflows that exist in both trees (e.g. `codeql.yml`),
   prefer the fork version — it usually has stricter pins and
   broader matrix legs.
3. `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is fork-authored; upstream has none.
   Never overwrite it on sync.

## OSSF Scorecard pin invariant

`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` references
`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@<sha>`. The Scorecard webapp at
`api.scorecard.dev` validates the pinned SHA against the action's
upstream repository on every publish; a SHA that no longer exists
under the declared tag (e.g. because upstream rewrote a release
branch or moved a tag) is rejected as an "imposter commit", returning
HTTP 400 and turning the workflow red. Whenever this pin is updated
(Renovate or manual), spot-check that the new SHA still resolves:

```bash
pin=$(grep -oE 'codeql-action/upload-sarif@[a-f0-9]{40}' \
      .github/workflows/scorecard.yml | head -1 | cut -d@ -f2)
gh api "/repos/github/codeql-action/commits/$pin" --jq '.sha'
```

A 422 response here is the canary that the workflow is about to start
failing on the next push. See [ADR-0263](../docs/adr/0263-ossf-scorecard-policy.md)
and [Research-0053](../docs/research/0053-ossf-scorecard-investigation.md).

## macOS Vulkan-via-MoltenVK lane (ADR-0338)

`libvmaf-build-matrix.yml` carries an advisory lane
`Build — macOS Vulkan via MoltenVK (advisory)` that runs on
`macos-latest` (Apple Silicon). Rebase-sensitive invariants:

- The lane is gated `continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.experimental ==
  true && matrix.moltenvk == true }}`. The compound predicate is
  load-bearing — the matrix has other `experimental: true` rows
  (the macOS DNN lane) that must keep their default fail-fast
  behaviour. A naive simplification to `${{ matrix.experimental }}`
  would silently make those other rows advisory.
- `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` MUST point at
  `/opt/homebrew/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json` — the homebrew
  formula `molten-vk` lays the JSON under `etc/vulkan/`, NOT
  `share/vulkan/`. Do not "fix" the path; verify against
  `Formula/m/molten-vk.rb` if in doubt.
- The lane must NOT be added to `required-aggregator.yml` until one
  green run lands on `master`. See ADR-0338 §Decision.
- The existing `Run tests` / cache / tox steps gate on
  `!matrix.moltenvk` — the moltenvk lane runs its own dedicated
  Vulkan-only smoke step. Do not unify or the lane will try to run
  tox tests against an Apple-Vulkan build, which is not the lane's
  contract.

See [ADR-0338](../docs/adr/0338-macos-vulkan-via-moltenvk-lane.md)
and [`docs/backends/vulkan/moltenvk.md`](../docs/backends/vulkan/moltenvk.md).

## Renovate (ADR-0363) supersedes Dependabot

Note: pin updates to `codeql-action/upload-sarif` now arrive via Renovate
(grouped with other GitHub Actions minor+patch bumps), not Dependabot.
